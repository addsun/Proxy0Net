Although I don't understand why, since the last transaction was on August 7, the effective balance on your account is zero and so you cannot forge.\nIn reality it doesn't mean anything.

For the past couple of year an account of mine that holds a considerably bigger amount of NXT has forged only some 300 NXT altogether. It generally forges around a block a day, but many blocks do not hold a transaction so no fee is paid to the forger.",
