Then, after some time, come back and sort the address then search for a good one. Is there a better way?\n(e.g. where can I find the hash / crypto library so I can do the brute force from a more effective runtime, say Erlang instread of doing process call from the terminal (which sounds slow due to the overhead))",

Take for instance I post a comment, my server sends it to others while being decentralised. Hope this clears anything up, ask me anything for more info if I didn't explain clearly 😀\n\nBut you could not distribute it to the internet without ISP eventually (directly or indirectly with other's help)",
