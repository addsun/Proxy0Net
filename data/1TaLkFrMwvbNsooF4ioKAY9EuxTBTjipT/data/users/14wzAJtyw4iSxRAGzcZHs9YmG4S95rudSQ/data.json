Phishing, malware, spying via your cameras or microphones. it also allows You to keep your wifi from being used for criminal activity. Your name is on the account, so if someone used your SO to steal credit card info, or bitcoins, etc. You could find yourself in trouble for something that you are not guilty of.  \nYou can still offer people use of your wifi. Just put in a password and let others know to see you for the info.",
