For technical details on Zeronet, check the presentation hosted at google doc, the official documentation hosted at readthedocs.io, and the source code (If you think the source code size is too big, you can check the Go port, which has limited features but has much less lines of code.)\n\nI don't think that's really a good idea if we take a look at the list of the threads. IMO this forum is in lack of manpower to category the contents.",

On the one hand we need full employment to regale the voters, on the other we are entering a new world where A.I. could very soon replace humans in most of the jobs, if not all. How could workers compete with A.I., which never requires a pay rise or complain about overwork? I see no policy address this issue at all, though it could be a much much bigger problem.",
