			"body": "Fight for the Future blew the whistle that US Congress is going to vote on whether to roll back the FCC's privacy protections, and the ISP industry has enough senators bought to rig the vote. If you are a US citizen, please please PLEASE call your senators RIGHT NOW. The link has phone numbers for those that are sympathetic. If you care at all about an uncomprimised Internet, this is something you need to spread, or the dollar-per-hollar shills will make life that much harder. \n\nhttps://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-03-23-congress-votes-today-on-whether-to-gut-the-fccs/\n\nEDIT: Now it has to pass the House of Representatives. Just as a reminder: If the House votes yes, your personal data such as which banks you visit, hospitals and doctors you trust, your worker associations, all of that can and will be inferred from the metadata that the ISPs will be allowed to collect and sell, potentially making you get blackballed from a higher-paying job or targeted for discrimination. PLEASE call your reps and tell them to vote no on the CRA vote on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/we-have-24-hours-save-online-privacy-rules",

			"title": "OpenSSL build tutorial",
			"body": "Oh hai ZeroTalk.\n\nI've written a tutorial for building an OpenSSL binary and the required libraries for Android devices; this enables your device to encrypt data on device, prior to sending across the internet. This enables one to, say, encrypt an photo record of some undesirable activity to store safely in a cloud.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is one implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer standard, which basically enables you to use the un-snoopable HTTPS to connect to websites, keeping sensitive data such as banking information, medical records and queries or career applications from being modified in transit in between you and the bank/hospital/job in question. It is symmetrical encryption, which means that there is one key, unlike your ZeroNet identity keys, which are asymmetrical and have two keys, public and private. The two models provide different advantages and disadvantages, dictating which situations which each are best suited for.\n\nOpenSSL provides the source code for a symmetrical encryption binary, which is what the tutorial details how to create. A prebuilt binary and the required libraries have been provided for ARM-based devices. The tutorial itself can be found [here](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Bo6oCbFEMhy1ejrehrSTGxiotgDsYCMJq/?Post:6:OpenSSL+for+Android+Build+Tutorial) at my ZeroBlog. Prebuilts, for those inclined, can be found [here](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Bo6oCbFEMhy1ejrehrSTGxiotgDsYCMJq/loader/index.html?1GV786wK).\n\nPlease feel free to comment and question below and at the blog. I'll try to answer to the best of my ability. [ZeroMail](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Mail.ZeroNetwork.bit/?to=rythyrix) is also accepted.",

Instead it's a compatibility layer to translate the system calls from Windows dotexes to Linux ones, and back again on the return trip. Running Wine by itself would be futile, so there's no premade shortcut. Instead, make an empty text document with the ```.desktop``` extension, i.e. ```wine-program.desktop``` following the example set by any that you currently possess on your machine. For example, this will work to start the ZeroNet.sh script:\n\n```[Desktop Entry]\nName=Start Zeronet\nComment=Censorship-resistent internet\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"cd /path/to/Zeronet/dir/  && ./ZeroNet.sh\"\nIcon=/path/to/znet_logo.jpg\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Network;FileTransfer;```\n\nThe ```[Desktop Entry]``` header is required to tell the system to start treating the file like a desktop entry, although due to the standard ```.desktop``` extension some systems can get away with just looking at the filename. Without it, most window managers display a text document icon, and the system opens it as a text document upon doubleclick.\n\n```Name=...``` is the displayed name of the shortcut when it is rendered by your window manager. Note that this does not change the filename; if you are interacting with it via the shell, you will need to specify whatever you saved it as, not what the line reads.\n\n```Exec=...``` is the command line that runs your given application. This example would navigate to ```/path/to/Zeronet/dir/``` and, if the directory exists, run the executable script or binary named ```ZeroNet.sh``` in the current directory. I prefer this way because it makes the ```$PWD``` environment variable be passed to the script's shell, preventing some bugs that can be difficult to track down.\n\n```Icon=...``` is the path and filename to the image file displayed by the shortcut. Depending on your system, it may only support jpegs, so be sure to convert if you are uncertain.\n\n```Type=...``` tells the system to open it as this MIME type. Typically, this will be Application.\n\n```Terminal=...``` tells the system to spawn or not spawn a terminal window when running the application via this shortcut. Typically, when running an application via the GUI, one doesn't want a popup :P\n\nCategories and Comments are typically optional. For more information, try the following two links:\n```https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles```\n```https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/```\n\nSo let's try this with a Windows app under Wine. Wine is special, since by default its desktop files reference the wineprefix's emulated Windows filesystem. Try the following Exec=... line:\n```Exec=env WINEPREFIX=/home/<insert username here>/.wine/ wine C:\\\\\\\\windows\\\\\\\\command\\\\\\\\start.exe C:\\\\\\\\path\\\\\\\\to\\\\\\\\exe\\\\\\\\file\\\\\\\\in\\\\\\\\wineprefix``` assuming that the dotexe is located (or even symlinked >:)) to a file in the wineprefix. This sets the environment variable ```WINEPREFIX```to the root of the wineprefix, which is required and will be created/populated if not extant, tells Wine to start the Windows program starter, which then starts the file specified.\n\nFor troubleshooting, first ensure you have permissions to execute both the ```.desktop``` file and the dotexe.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

As an aside, you'll need to use four backslashes, since under the hood you are passing the command through two passes of the command processor.\n\nB: NEVER run Wine as root. That will give any maliciously-infected Windows executable root access to your system, leading to Bad Things (tm).\n\nC: Making a ```.desktop``` file is the standard way of starting applications via the GUI. On Ubuntu, ordinary ```apt-get``` installs automatically do this by copying a prebuilt to ```/usr/share/applications``` folder, where they show up in the Unity Dash searchbox. Try the ```gnome-panel``` package, and the ```gnome-desktop-item-edit``` tool. This will be the only time you need to interact with the command line, assuming you plan ahead and create a new dotdesktop file to create new dotdesktop files :P\n\t1: Open a terminal and install the ```gnome-panel``` package with the following command line:\n\t\t```sudo apt-get install gnome-panel --no-install-recommends```\n\t2: Execute the following to open the GUI, while creating a new dotdesktop:\n\t\t```/usr/bin/gnome-desktop-item-edit /home/$USER/Desktop/ --create-new```\n\tThis functions because it is invoking the program, then the first argument says to place this new dotdesktop file in the directory specifed (feel free to replace the $USER with the name of your user, since the command is being invoked by your terminal, it will expand to whatever the ```USER``` environment variable is for that particular shell, can cause problems if you have a nonstandard shell) \n\t3: At the GUI, you will see an icon on the left, and a few fields. Click the icon to bring up a file picker and navigate to whatever icon you want displayed. \n\t4: Type should remain Application. Name will be whatever you want displayed by your window manager. Comment can be ignored, but may be useful if you ever come back to edit it and forget what the dotdesktop is for :P\n\t5: Finally, onto the Command field. This is what the ```Exec=...``` line is mapped to. Wine is special in that you will need to prefix the Linux location of the Windows executable with some arguments in order to make it work. For this example, I will be using ```/home/rythyrix/Desktop/catplanet.exe``` as the Windows executable I want to invoke.\n\t6: Obtain the Linux path of the executable to invoke, and the wineprefix you want to use as the root of the Windows system. In this case, ```/home/rythyrix/.wine/```\n\t7: Open a text editor, as it's easier to just copy/paste into the Command box of the Create Launcher GUI. Keep in mind that the dotdesktop file will not create\n\t8: Assemble the line as follows: ```env WINEPREFIX=\"<your wineprefix here>\" wine C:\\\\windows\\\\command\\\\start.exe /Unix \"<your Linux executable path here, with no expansions>\"``` For example, my line would be ```env WINEPREFIX=\"/home/rythyrix/.wine/\" wine C:\\\\windows\\\\command\\\\start.exe /Unix \"/home/rythyrix/Desktop/catplanet.exe\"```\n\t9: Copy/paste the completed command line into the Command box, then click OK. If all went well, you should now have a new dotdesktop on your desktop. Double-click  on it to test if it works.\n\t10: To make a dotdesktop to make new dotdesktops on your desktop (what a mouthful), place the following command line in the Command box: ```/usr/bin/gnome-desktop-item-edit /home/<your username here>/Desktop --create-new```, adjust Name/Icon as desired, and click OK. Keep in mind you cannot use environment/tilde expansion in the Command box, so you need to type the path without such expansions.\n\t11: If you are ever interested in learning the command line, this is a good place to start: ```http://www.linuxcommand.org/index.php```\n\nQuestions still welcome.",

Not resumming optional files enables zites to quickly publish new content. On the other hand, when one signs their zite, how does the parser tell not to resum? Timestamp checking, whilst useful, can be defeated with a simple ```touch -t $(date -d @UNIX_EPOCH_SECONDS +%y%m%d%H%m.%S) FILE```.

[...]\n\nLooking at the all.js under ZeroID, line 886 begins a function to send a https POST request to ```https://demo.zeronet.io/ZeroID/request.php```. Without your browser configured to use either a proxy or Tor, this request will be sent with your clearnet IP in its protocol header, enabling anyone with a packet sniffer on either your or the server's end to see where those packets were sent to/from. While the theoretical adversary cannot read the contents of the packets without breaking the encryption on the https stream, traffic correlation is a thing.\n\nOne safe(r) method to register a new ZeroID is to use the Tor Browser in a fresh instance of ZeroNet, unpacked under a different directory, get your new cert, and take the ```users.json``` from that instance of ZeroNet and swap out your old one. Since the private authkeys are stored under the one file, this method will not allow you to post anything under your old ZeroID. ZeroNet does not currently support multiple IDs from the same cert authorizer, so you will want to keep the two separate and swap them out as needed, restarting ZeroNet to swap them.\n\nRemember: ***LOSING ALL COPIES OF YOUR PRIVATE KEY IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOVER FROM***. Make encrypted backups, preferably asymmetrical to make a brute forcer's job that much harder. Of course, asymm has the problem of shifting the responsibility of keeping the private key safe from your ZeroNet keys to your asymm keys, but symmetrical encryption is too easy to brute force; assume your file will be attacked with upwards of 1,000,000,000,000 guesses/sec. Length is has more protection than complexity, after a point. Has to do with [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics)... and I'm rambling.",

Recommended that each file is less than 10M.\n\nMax size TOTAL for a zite is default 10MB; I ran into the max size limit issue, if a file is not classified as optional, it contributes towards the maximum size a zite can be. If you are for some reason adverse to not forcing people to download the PDFs the moment they load your zite, you can force the maximum higher by dragging the purple 0's sidebar open, scrolling down to ```SIZE LIMIT```,  and increasing the size. This will allow ZeroNet to use more data for your zite, but also forces peers to accept a larger size immediately to continue downloading a zite.\n\nI really do recommend using optional files; they make visitors happy by not forcing them to download a file they may not want. To enable it, back up your zite's content.json, then add the following object:\n```\n...\n \"modified\": 1496038455,\n \"optional\": \"(big/.*)\",\n \"sign\": [\n...\n```\nreplacing 'big' with whatever the folder you want to store optional files in is. ```\"optional\":``` denotes a [Python regular expression](http://www.regular-expressions.info/) (clearnet), or pregex for short, that if the pregex matches the file path of a given file under your zite's root, it is marked as optional. For example, myNullPaste has the optional object containing ```\"(loader/files/.*)\"```.  All files that such a pregex matches will be marked as optional. Anything that does not is either ignored (if the ```\"ignore\":``` object is set) or mandatory. It's considered polite to place large files as optional, and provide links to them to save on other user's disk space; this allows low-space nodes to seed your zite without worrying about running out of disk space. If you truly need another seed for a very large file, consider asking a proxy operator if they are willing to host it as well. Naturally, different users' opinions about what size is considered very large will vary. I personally consider any one file over 25Mb to be required to be optional before I continue seeding; comes from running nodes on Android devices' internal storage.",

				"body": "Net neutrality requires that no matter what the data traveling across their network is, ISPs must treat it the same as any other data. Bandwidth restrictions on P2P protocols (BitTorrent especially) have been throttled before, and the removal of the Open Internet Order's teeth would allow ISPs to fuck with your Internet connection to *incentivize* you to pay pay-TV prices for DSL speeds. Not content with charging more for the same speed, ISPs could also charge for access to specific sites, such as Netflix and Google, or they could simply block all Tor traffic legally and there goes one private Internet. Or block all banking sites unless they pony up another fee, which will be passed along to you, the customer.\n\nIn regards to ZeroNet, it's P2P, which ISPs have a monetary incentive to throttle in the form of bribes from wrongsholders, greater bandwidth availability to higher-paying customers and further siloization and vendor lock-in with existing customers.\n\nTake the cable box probably sitting on your television vanity; a proprietary black box you get charged out the nose to have to offer one-tenth the utility of an Internet connection. Without net neutrality, the ISPs who own the last ~30 feet of wire to your home would be able to filter, spoof, hijack and modify all the traffic in your connection to present the side of a political story influencing you to vote whatever way they want, or simply stop your post on a given issue from ever reaching anyone else, censoring your opinion at the whim of whomever pays them the most money that hour.\n\nIn summary, net neutrality is **rather important** to the continued freedom of expression one enjoys online, and is the lifeblood of P2P projects everywhere, including ZeroNet. So yes, the erosion Matters.",

That creates a chilling effect where unknown sites won't receive new peers, keeping them stillborn and centralizing everyone to the standard zites all over again.

If you're connecting via clearnet, or using Tor-only mode but not using a browser configured to route all traffic through Tor, then it is fairly easy to suss out who a given IP addr is. ZN assigns a peer ID to itself whenever a non-Tor connection is solicited.\n\nThere are ways to completely isolate oneself from any clearnet monitoring entity, mostly thru Tor. But of course, best practice is to simply never type anything personal in ZN to begin with.",
