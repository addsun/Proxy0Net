Could anybody help me find the digital version (e.g pdf/djvu or other format) of Lateinische Grammatik Band 2 by Leumann/Hoffmann/Szantyr? If found, please upload it to Library Genesis, thank you! Gratias tibi ago, et deus te benedicat!",

One master piece of a guide to Latin is e.g. Grundwissen Lateinische Grammatik by Langenscheidt.\n\nThank you, but the problem is I can't find this book either.",

If you really HAVE to get it as an ebook then I don't know if there are any Latin ebooks out there, since this language isn't \"the hot stuff\" when people decide which secondary language to study.\n\nIt's only 12 bucks? WOW. I thought it must be at least 120 Euro like that book by Leumann.",
