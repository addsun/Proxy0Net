User clicks \"install browser extension\" and installs a browser extension which will make it REALLY EASY for the user to install zeronet. I mean a 1-click no-questions-asked install.\n3. Magic happens in the background --- extension knows when zeronet is online.\n3. User sees my site, and from now on can magically follow any zeronet link (.bit addresses etc), and will help host zeronet whenever his computer is online.",

But not yet.\n\nIn the meantime, the installation process could be made 1-click simple.\n\nI might try to program such a thing eventually if noone picks it up beforehand.",
