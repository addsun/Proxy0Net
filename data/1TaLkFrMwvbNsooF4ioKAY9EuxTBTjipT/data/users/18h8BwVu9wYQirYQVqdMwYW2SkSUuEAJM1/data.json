But it needs the participants pouring more energy into maintaining schedules than meeting a partner in real life, so most of the people abandoned it after several weeks of trying to do the right thing.",

I haven't had a single friend in years. I don't travel further than my own room. I don't sleep at night because when i close my eyes i think I'm drowning. Ive learned that hell isn't something you experience when your dead. My existence is hell. This is my punishment. I deserve it too.\n\nIs there somewhere you can go, and get socialized with other people? I think may be you are just too lonely?",
