I mean, how you can you not like a group that's against fascists?\n\nBecause they slander large groups as people as fascist, often based on their own prejudices. I can't wait to watch your tactics backfire as every self-respecting white guy get's tired of your crap.  Too bad you're busy \"bashing\" people in the interests of international capitalism. \n\nPeople demanding self-determination for their own communities have more legitimacy, than those who punch \"racists\".",
