				"body": "Agreed, actually if you remember the internet anonymity project previous to this, Freenet, we should be so lucky that we only get flooded with cat pictures and trolls. We need something like Freenet's \"Web of Trust\", where upvoting / downvoting occurs reddit style but applies not only to a post, but percolates between users. For example if you upvote a post, people who've upvoted your posts will see that post go up, while if you downvote a post, people who've upvoted your posts will see that post go down. You're influenced by the upvotes and downvotes of people you've upvoted, but not that of people you've downvoted. This goes a fair way down the chain too.",

[...]\n\nI think people have tried since I remember hearing about a few things like that. The problem is that as Bitcoin becomes more popular it also gets more regulated. So if it's a currency it means that you don't have to pay taxes when you trade it (good), but you can't just buy it without identification (problematic).\n\nAlso when I was googling it I noticed that it went up another $300 since this morning. Wow. Bitcoin.com has a list of exchanges that might help you if you weren't aware already.",
