			"body": "I'm currently reading Peter Kropotkin's \"The Conquest of Bread\", which every human being should read in my opinion. In the book Kropotkin says that if the next revolution wants be a social revolution one of the main problems to solve is the distribution and management of food. \n\nSo i was thinking about a decentralized application that alows every houshold to mange their food inventory and if a revolution is starting every house, disctrict and city knows exactly how much food and what kind of groceries are currently availiable. Of course an aplication like that must be simple to use and have lots of features in order to get users. For example a shopping list component. \n\nWhat do you think about this idea?",

Even a clone of zero talk would be enough to start I guess.\n\nThanks for your encouraging comment. I will definitely try to create something here on ZN.",
