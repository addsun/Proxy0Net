The site could provide mining pool details and then the plugin would mine XMR to the selected pool in the background.  From the user's perspective, perhaps there could be a confirmation asking for permission to mine in exchange for showing the site.",

(Sophisticated users may well be able to get around the requirement anyway.)  Furthermore, site maintainers can tune the parameters to find out what the market price (in hashes/s) of their content actually is.",
