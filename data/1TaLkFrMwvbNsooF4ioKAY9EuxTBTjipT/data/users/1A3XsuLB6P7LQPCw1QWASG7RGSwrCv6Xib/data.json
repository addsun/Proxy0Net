			"title": "ZeroStore ZeroCart ZeroMarket Shopping Carts on ZeroNet",
			"body": "Hi, I dreamt up some ideas for how to have a store on ZeroNet, somewhat in line with ZenCart but \"simpler\". \n\nThe orders can be public-key encrypted, so even though everyone is sharing them in the database, only the seller can see what they are.  \n\nThe payment method can be through any cryptocurrency. The site can be preloaded with addresses, so that each order gets it's own address, and that way can more easily track who paid for their order -- alternatively the sending address would have to be provided by whoever is requesting the product or service.  Could probably even accept paypal, though I wouldn't recommend credit card, since the details would be shared by everyone, even if encrypted. \n\nThe seller can be notified of new purchases by having a bot on their zeronet instance checking for them, and then sending an email once it detects a new order. \n\nOne of the issues would be with obsolete stores, or those which are no longer maintained.  One way to mitigate that would be for the buyer to wait for a confirmation email from the seller before paying. \nI don't know if zeromail has bot handles, but if it does then that could be a possible alternative.\n\nAnother option would be to have a ZeroMarket place with multi-signature transactions.  So could have the same level of buyer/seller protection as Paypal.  For example a buyer makes an order, and puts it into a buyer-seller escrow, the seller then ships the item,  once the item has arrived in good working order, then the buyer finishes the transaction and-or writes a review,  if there is some problem the marketplace admins can either refund or give funds as appropriate.",

			"title": "Monetizing ZeroNet (Making money from ZeroNet)",
			"body": "I see two ways of making monetizing ZeroNet. \n\n1. ZeroNet VPN\n\nThe first is something many people could do.   We've had some free clearnet portals of ZeroNet in the past, but likely due to the high level of traffic they weren't able to cope and closed down.  One possibility is to make a portal with a ZeroNet portal with a paywall through a VPN, possibly over the tor network.  This would be particularly useful for mobile devices, and for people that don't want to be storing and sharing the content which they visit.\n\nFor providers of this service, the main thing to think about, is where to store such servers. It would have to be either countries which don't mind the content on them, or have sufficiently strict privacy laws that they wont check whats on them.   Of course in any case it will be best to encrypt the ZeroNet partition, and it would need a large amount of space. \nIf using the tor network for the VPN, then the physical location of the server shouldn't matter too much, so long as there are proper encryption mechanisms in place. \n\n2.  ZeroNet Coin\n\nThe second method is a little bit more involved, and would probably require co-operation of @nofish.  The purpose of the ZeroNet coin, could be avoid certain forms of DDNS which ZeroNet may still be prone to, such as if there was a botnet of modified ZeroNet clients, which only pulled content, and did not share it -- which could if there were enough of them, overload certain websites and make them hard to access for normal users. \n\nThat form of DDNS could be circumvented by serving people that make donations with ZeroNet coin first.  Much like GridCoin, ZeroNet coin could be a reward for contributing bandwidth and storage to the network (for free). The clients would have to be modified so that they would keep track of who gave them how many kiB at what average speed (maybe even what sites). Then some kind of trusted peer consensus would have to be reached, to avoid clients pretending they got stuff to game the system. Several trusted peers can check if they get similar results from that host over a period of time (to also gauge uptime).  \nThere can probably some process of how a peer goes to become a trusted peer, based on having results like the other trusted peers for a certain period of time. \n\nAnyways, that's just an idea, would have to be fleshed out by some people more familiar with modern cryptocurrencies.",

				"body": "@evo thanks, but I find both python and coffeescript to be very difficult because they rely on whitespace to convey meaning. So looking at the overview does not mean I'll be done, it just deepened my feeling of intimidation.  I can't pronounce symbols and-or whitespace in my head (meaningfully) so I really dislike when languages use symbols/whitespace to convey meaning instead of words, and coffeescript seems to like doing so .   Every symbol/whitespace that is used to convey a meaningful construct deepens my dislike of a language. \n\nIn part because of this difficulty I'm working on a programming language based on linguistic universals, that uses Zero symbols/whitespace. In fact don't even need to have spaces in between the words. Additionally it allows for translating between all human languages with high precision, so I hope to employ it on ZeroNet to help with translation, so for instance Chinese and English speakers could use the same forum seamlessly -- while also generating valid programming code. \n\n@nofish thanks I did follow the ZeroChat tutorial, it was good thanks. Though afterwards when I went to look at the API is when I ran into problems with coffeescript examples.   Fortunately by using the coffee -c compilation I was able to compile it into something that made sense to me.",

It's a huge problem for bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies that have become centralized as difficulty rose. For smaller currencies it becomes an easy target, depending on the number of nodes. [...]\n\n\"Gridcoin has eliminated the possibility of a 51% attack, an attack on a standard Proof-of-Work coin, which involves a single entity owning a minimum of 51% of the total network hash rate. To attack Gridcoin in a similar way, the attacker would have to make a 51% buy-out, meaning he needs to own 51% of all the coins. In addition to the 51%, the attacker would have to buy and hold the cumulative stake weight of all nodes with fewer than 30 blocks staked. Since interest is being payed to those who let their nodes run for the network, transaction fees are not needed in theory. However they are still enforced to prevent transaction spam on a single node.\n\n\"These improvements were already made by Blackcoin, which Gridcoin, in an effort to keep up with current technology has implemented. Blackcoin also included the [Zerocash] protocol, a process enabling anonymous transactions.\"\n\n\n> Personally, I think if ZeroNet was going to add a cryptocurrency, why not just include a basic bitcoin wallet, or namecoin wallet? All the core dev-work is there, it's massively popular and watched like a hawk, and it'd fit right in with zeronet addresses/users by default. \n\nWell Namecoin addresses start with an N, so they are different than the Bitcoin addresses used by ZeroNet. \nAlso Bitcoin transactions fees are so high that it doesn't make sense for micro-transactions, the transaction fee for bitcoin was about 1 NMC last time I checked, much higher than even bank e-transfers. \n\nAlso the whole point of having a ZeroNet cryptocurrency is to reward people for seeding ZeroNet. It would be impossible to do with a foreign currency as we would actually have to buy that currency, in order to use it to reward people. \n\nThough a modification of gridcoin could work, where instead of having work-units for helping science, it would be work-units of serving clients.\n\n\"Gridcoin features Proof-of-Research (POR) algorithm, in partnership with Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing,[3] commonly known as BOINC (pronounced /bɔɪŋk/ - rhymes with \"oink\"). This protocol rewards users of the network once they have completed the computational work unit (WU) in BOINC by linking their Cross-Project ID (CPID) to their Gridcoin wallet. The reward for computation is a proportional payment of Gridcoin (GRC) based on calculations involving the user's recent average credit (RAC).\"\n\n\"Gridcoin is created daily from two activities, Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Research. Proof of Research is produced at a targeted rate of about 50,000 coins per 1000 blocks. A factor is used to adjust rewards to achieve this target and is called a Magnitude Unit and is stored in the blockchain. If the number of coins generated is too low the Magnitude Unit increases, this increases the number of coins paid for a certain magnitude, if the number of coins generated is too high the Magnitude Unit decreases, this decreases the number of coins paid for a certain magnitude. This has the effect of balancing Proof-of-Research payments with Proof-of-Stake payments. Effectively, if fewer researchers are helping to secure the network, the incentive is increased. \"\n\n> With a ZN-specific coin, nofish's time and effort would be even more divided than it already is.\n\nYes, I agree it would make most sense if someone familiar with GridCoin development or at least cryptocurrency development was to spearhead that.   It can be completely or partially independent of ZeroNet main branch. \n\nIf there was a selective clear-net passthrough, (where only particular websites are served to the clearnet),  then ZeroNet could get paid for hosting certain large/commercial clearnet websites,  the coin software would then distribute the coin based on who served what. \nOf course there would have to be a whole extra layer for verification, such as the web clients sending the serving a main server the hash of the site they received, to make sure they got the whole thing. \n\nThis would make ZeroNet kind of like the ultimate cloud hosting solution.",
