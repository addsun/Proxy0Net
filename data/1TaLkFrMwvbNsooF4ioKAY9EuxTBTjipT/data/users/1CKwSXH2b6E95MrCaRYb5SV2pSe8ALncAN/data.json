This private key isn't designed to be human readable.\nYour id is associated with a temporary public key [2], which is generated from a private key [2]. This private key is designed to be human readable.\n\nTo confirm your identity you can sign a message with either private key.\n\nAt any point in time you can update your public key [2] to a new value, as long as you sign the update message with your private key [1].\n\nSo the purpose is to gain the usability of having a human readable key, while still keeping some of the security of having a non human readable key.",
