Especially people straight out of high school who are worried about their future. Even very low level jobs are now requiring some kind of degree in the US. You pretty much cant get a single decent job without one. It never used to be that way. But hey big companies, corporations, and schools love to fuck everyone in anyway possible. The sytem shovels shit in our faces and the mindless drones of society just keep their mouths wide open because their constantly hungry for more bullshit",
