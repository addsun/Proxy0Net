			"body": "When I include webfonts hosted alongside a ZeroNet site, the browser shows an error saying, \"'access-control-allow-origin' header is present on the requested resource\". It seems that ZeroNet's webserver needs to send a CORS HTTP header when serving webfonts.\n\nAm I missing something? Is there a way to configure it, or is this a bug in the software? \n\nAs a workaround, I'm currently just using google fonts, but obviously that runs counter to the purpose of using a distributed network.",

Packages like Algo and Streisand hold your hand through the entire process, and having a your own host avoids being blocked by VPN blacklists. Sans promotion, I think OVH has the cheapest machines out of the big providers, but it lacks support for automatically deploying machines with the aforementioned packages.",
