I don't know much about how Zeronet works, but wouldn't the protocol we use just be blanket banned by them since it isn't an HTTP request to a domain they've specifically allowed?\n\nNo since there are other country's which dont follow the fcc and either way zeronet doesn't need to use the Internet that much to work since me and other people are syncing and sharing without the ISP's network. Take for instance I post a comment, my server sends it to others while being decentralised. Hope this clears anything up, ask me anything for more info if I didn't explain clearly ðŸ˜€",
