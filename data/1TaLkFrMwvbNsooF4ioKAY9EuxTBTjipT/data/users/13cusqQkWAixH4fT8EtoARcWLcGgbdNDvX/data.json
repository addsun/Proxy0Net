I thought maybe only 1 was supposed to be active from what I was trying to google it seemed like \"pick one or the other\"",

Did you install any of those packages yourself?\n\nI'm running TinkerOS (Debian Stretch base) it's for a tinkerboard SoC like Pi, I didn't install them I don't think the other things I installed were lighttpd and bind9",

I'll monitor further to make sure I don't see anything off in the logs. I just want to kill off everything that's not needed for the webserver which will bring me closer to catching any errors that take it offline like the networking issue",
