Even classical music (Johann Strauss, Mozart) would get flagged.\n&nbsp;\nOf course, my biggest worry is that there will come a point when YouTubers will look at the site, and accuse us of stealing their ad revenue. I mean, there's already been videos uploaded that belong to Linus Tech Tips.. a famous computer techie and video maker. \n&nbsp;\n.. which is why I've started doing research on cryptocurrency mining and Basic Income. Creative content creators draw people to your site, so it makes sense for them to be rewarded. The zite itself won't ever run cryptocurrency miners or ads, of course.. ...  the revenue will mostly come from my proxies, and future web empires that I might build on the clearnet. ;)",

The code is re-written from scratch, and features smooth routing, faster loading pages. Coffee script files are produced to make development easier, by reverse-engineering the ZeroUp code and logic.\n0.3.x (still BETA) will feature bots and python scripts that make stuff easier.. e.g. Video encoding, reporting and deleting disturbing content, paying a share of ZeroNet proxy mining revenues to channel owners, etc. \n\n1.x.x will be the official stable release, if everything goes according to plan. ZeroNet proxies will aid in marketing KopyKate as a copyright-free and political censorship-free video platform, whose revenue will be used to fund cryptocurrency-based wealth-redistribution schemes (UBI).

As a YouTuber and content creator myself, I might actually migrate to the site completely one day, and make it my home.\n&nbsp;\nAudible Magic is simply the most fascistic piece of garbage ever conceived. You could be walking down a street and filming a video .. ... and all of the sudden, comes a car with the speakers on max volume, playing 50 Cent. That alone was enough to get your video flagged at times. Even classical music will get you flagged.\n&nbsp;\nI like putting background music on some of my videos because, that's the tune that I feel fits the video the best. I'm not much of a composer, and I'd like to be part of internet culture ... but with all the money that you need in order to buy the rights to all the songs, and the rights of all the PNGs, JPGs, that you've used in your video ... ... ...

Cryptocurrencies could be a good way to pay for such a scheme.\n&nbsp;\nIf we ever did end up replacing media streaming services, then it would be our duty to make money out of it, and redistribute a lot of that wealth. A ZeroNet mega-proxy would be a good way to do it, simply because it's not a good idea to put cryptocurrency miners on zites (they could easily be removed by simply going into the data folder after every update, deleting the Javascript, etc.).

I'll be sure to include your username in the credits for KopyKate BIG 0.2.0 :)\n\n**The official ZeroFrame Router - by Krixano**\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1K2myjtjoEVpRC2JMieRL73ES4V4iLP2Ev/",
