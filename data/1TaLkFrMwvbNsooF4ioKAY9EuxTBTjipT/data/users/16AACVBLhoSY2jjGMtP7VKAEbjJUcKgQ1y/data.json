In addition, members of the Trump administration have just recently started (renewed?) a campaign of demonizing \"welfare\" and waxing inspirational about the \"dignity of work\". Also, the once-in-a-generation \"tax reform\" that may very well become law later this month will further erode the tax base (it's a major handout to the wealthy and to large corporations) and add significantly to the national defecit and, consequently, the debt. So not only will we not be considering a UBI any time soon, we'll be looking at gutting Medicare and Social Security in a few years. A Republican senator admitted as much on a morning show today, though obviously he didn't use the word \"gutting\".",

For people who want to work in a big multinational corporation and get overseas postings, or work in the Foreign Service, or have some particular academic interest, sure, learn some other language. But many Americans and Canadians will never leave the continent, and will never work in a job that deals with, say, Chinese imports. However, in any major city, or anywhere south of Idaho from California to Texas, or any town or county that has an industry that draws Mexican or Central American immigrants you'll be surrounded by people who speak Spanish. And it can get you a job. When my gf started out in banking, she got the job over other applicants largely because she spoke some Spanish. Started at a higher wage because of it, too. We don't even live in an area that you'd associate with a significant Hispanic population. Ironically, she actually spoke some Chinese, too, because she had taken several semesters of it in college. They had zero interest in that ability, of course.",
