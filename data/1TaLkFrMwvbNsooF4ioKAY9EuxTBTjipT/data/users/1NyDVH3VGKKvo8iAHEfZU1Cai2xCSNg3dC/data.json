Take for instance I post a comment, my server sends it to others while being decentralised. Hope this clears anything up, ask me anything for more info if I didn't explain clearly ðŸ˜€\n\nyou're still using the copper owned by the ISPs to send and receive zeronet information, friend. you are very much still using the internet just as much as you do when going to regular sites like google or youtube, the only difference is how the content is hosted. zeronet's purpose is to combat censorship.",
