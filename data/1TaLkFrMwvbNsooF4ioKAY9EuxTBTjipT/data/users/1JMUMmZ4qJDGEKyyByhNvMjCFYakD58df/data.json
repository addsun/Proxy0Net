			"body": "Hi zeronet, I know it is possible to set files to be optional, so they are only downloaded when requested. But is it possible to set files uploaded by users as optional?\n\nLet's say I would like to make a video sharing site, and when I upload a video to the site, it would be added to `data/users/[user-id]/movie1.mp4`. How can I make all user uploaded .mp4 files, optional?",
