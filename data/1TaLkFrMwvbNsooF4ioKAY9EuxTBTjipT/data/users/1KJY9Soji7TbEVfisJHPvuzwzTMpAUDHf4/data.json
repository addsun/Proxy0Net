Once it is done it is done.\n\nRather than dwelling on such thought think of your ideas. How we can better our environment. How we can work together. How we can help others to feel better. How we can self-realize our selves. Don't you feel better when you see people happy because of what you do? Surely there are a lot of jerks and idiots out there. But hey! You cannot make everybody happy. I repeat, you cannot make everybody happy with you and what you do. That's fine. As long as some of them are happy you will feel satisfied enough.\n\nThink about those unfortunately enough. No food. No shelters. No safety.\n\nQuestion is, how can we help (with our nerdy skills) make them better?",
