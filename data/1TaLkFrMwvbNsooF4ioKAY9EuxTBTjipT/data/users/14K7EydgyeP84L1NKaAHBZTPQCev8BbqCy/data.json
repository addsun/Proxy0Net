It's two clicks max for both. Want to upload some content? New site -> paste your files -> sign -> publish -> share. That simple. On the clearnet? Well first you need to go pay for hosting (because who self-hosts? If you do, you need to call up your ISP for a static IP or find another solution), then you need to go buy a domain name, both of which you need to pay yearly for. Set up the nameservers properly so they point your domain to your host. Wait however many hours that all takes. Then ftp or ssh into your server and upload your files. It's a huge pain and expensive. [...]\n\nI host my own website on a Raspberry Pi. It's only 25â‚¬ or so, _one time_, and for domain, I first used a free Dyn-DNS-provider (No-IP), and now I somewhat switched (still re-activating the No-IP-domain :D) to a domain I bought, which costs only 0.75cents a month (or so,.. I forgot xD).\nFor HTTPS I use LetsEncrypt. Not everybody thinks it's good or so, but I think so.\n\nYes, I admit, it all was somewhat hard'ish to set up, but I mean, _why not_!? :D\nIt was definitely worth learning about all that stuff.\n\nBut: I do agree, that a clearnet-site is not as safe as a zite in ZeroNet, and because I pretty much have nobody who visits my site, I can't really talk about how good _or bad_ the server actually is x(.\n\nAbout the thing that the user has full control of posting stuff, _maybe_,.. because I could just go into ThunderWave's code, and edit it, so that User 1 only sees messages from a selected range. Not everybody _can_ code, not everybody _wants_ to code, not everybody is concerned about his data's _security_ (hmm, the last is somewhat not the case for probably _any_ user on the ZeroNet :D), so if User 1 is just a \"normal\" End-User, _why_ should he check the code?!\nAfter all, ZeroNet isn't *just* for coders/programmers/whatever (or at least, it shouldn't!), but also for the everyday end-user, who just want's to go a different way, than the clearnet.\n\nZites are not always up. If all users just delete it, or have no internet access, then the user wanting to access the zite won't be able to download it (xD that's kind of a stupid argument right there, but _everything can happen_ (though, this _is_ true for somewhat private website e.g. a blog)).\n\nSo all in all, I totally agree with what you wrote! xD\n(PS.: I read it all x_O)",
