So are many other websites (geti2p.net Norway mirror distribution).  If you are desperate and can't get through I suggest a VPN to a country with a whole setup.  For example:  you setup your computer for Danish and exit in Copenhagen from your VPN and try to reach github or i2p.  You can mix Tor before VPN if they get you.  As always check signatures and shasums or download from different locations and file compare.  Flatpak and firejail should be your friends (Firefox Developer and Nightly comes already  Flatpaked).  I agree with you that all ZeroNet versions should be SIGNED and posted at gitcenter.  That BoneHead host does not understand your request.  On the other hand if you use Windows you are screwed anyway!\n\nThis here is called vpn tor chaining. Or you could run a VPN through DNS. But heck, doubt the fella has issues. Probably lazy to dig Git releases tab for win downloads",
