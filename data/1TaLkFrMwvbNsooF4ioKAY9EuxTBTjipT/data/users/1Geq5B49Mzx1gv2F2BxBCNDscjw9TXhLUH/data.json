			"body": "Since there are so many Chinese users I thought it would be a cool idea to set up a Zerotalk-like forum that uses software translation to bridge the English-Chinese language gap and open up more collaboration (even if the translations aren't perfect). I.e. if you're Chinese, every English post gets translated into simplified/traditional characters or vice versa. Maybe using something like http://opennmt.net/\n\nDoes anything like this exist?",

But why the same profile on Windows running Noscript with ZeroNet, and on Linux no longer? And why it worked in Linux before I updated Firefox to 54 version?\n\nOh that's strange, I'm not too sure why that would happen (I'm also using ZeroNet with Arch Linux). Until that's fixed it might help to use a separate browser for ZeroNet so you don't need to turn it on and off repeatedly-- I would suggest trying it out with the Tor Browser if you haven't already",
