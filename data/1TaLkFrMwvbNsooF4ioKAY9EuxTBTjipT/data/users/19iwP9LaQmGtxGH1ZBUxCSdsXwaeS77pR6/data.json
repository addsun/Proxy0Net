Maybe you can't find out what have been transferred, but you can doubt someone using ss, and make sure after a simple test. It's because ss was not design to deal with such a situation.My suggestion is, don't use anyone of ss family, at least recently, don't. ss or ssr, just don't use them neither. China's anti-anti-GFW strategy has periods. Recently, it's seems to be ss. I don't wanna try if it is truth by myself. You may try ss/ssr again after a month or two. If it's really has problem, you'll be blocked. But police will not after you.\n\nTechnically the vanilla SS before a specific version is detectable. SSR with obfs-ing is much more harder to detect.",
