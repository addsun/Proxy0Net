				"body": "I've been suffering with depression since i was a child. I tried to commit suicide when i was 6 ever since then I have been on steady medication. During this time of year the medication helps but i still get down with the weather and the temps. Sleep is very crucial, a pattern, get enough of it, and try to stay awake long enough not get too much of it. Keep yourself busy with a time waster. If I get to the point of \"ghosting\" I usually just stay in bed until i feel like getting out... I avoid this point as much as i can, there is not much you can do, or that I've found myself, that you can do to get out of it.  This time of year, even with my meds holding me up the depression gets though, and lack of sleep can make me start dipping. For me its not what to do to once i'm depressed, its how to avoid getting into the cycle in the first place... food and sleep helps for when you do fall into the cycle as it seems easier to get out.",
