			"body": "Has anyone tried running ZeroNet on a mesh network without the traditional internet infrastructure? Is it possible to do this yet? I read somewhere that it still uses a central tracker to connect peers, rather than something like DHT. Also, the central reliance on ZeroName, along with Namecha.in (which isn't even a part of zeronet!) seems problematic.\n\nI feel ZeroNet really needs to be able to sever any connection with the regular clearnet, and be able to ran on mesh networks in order to really embrace the idea of decentralization, as well as be able to take off and become a useful tool, rather than just an interesting play-thing.\n\nA decentralized meshnet combined with a decentralized web seems like a match made in heaven. Combine that with the other P2P technologies, and you'd effectively be able to ignore and ditch the ISP monopolies, as well as prevent any sort of bullying by large companies.\n\nAs it stands, ZeroNet still relies on ICANN to distribute IP addresses, domain names (the Namecha.in domain), and relies on various internet backbone companies in order to distribute the data. This is still dangerously centralized in my opinion.\n\nIs this on the to-do? Is it even on nofish's radar? What's everyone's thoughts on such a thing?",

			"body": "Scraping zites for content is inherently problematic, due to the way ZeroNet functions. For a typical site, you just send a request to the page, get the page content, and do as you please. However, doing this on a ZeroNet site results in getting the ZeroNet wrapper, rather than the page itself. Instead, you have to resolve the javascript and load the iframe, and *then* grab the iFrame's content.\n\nAFAIK, there's no clean way to do this in Javascript.\n\nZeroMail comes with some echobot scripts that manages to scrape the page to look for email. I've adapted this script to work in a general fashion (since I was changing it to scrape site lists for Kaffiene). [Here's the generalized script.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/?1NWh3WAty57FH8at1WtrZigMrdhrDkuPzh_3)\n\nAs you can see it requires the selenium library along with phantomjs, which is a piece of software that runs websites and properly resolves the page.\n\nI was wondering what other solutions there might be, that don't rely on using selenium/phantomjs, or may even be entirely javascript.\n\nFrom my understanding, this is the problem that merger sites are meant to solve: a local/client way (javascript/coffeescript) to grab content from other ZeroNet sites.\n\nThoughts?",

I know it's the same for you guys, since we have a very small, not very active community here. So have at it: what's so great that's driving you away from ZeroNet and back to the clearnet?\n\nFor me, I always wander back to Reddit for the news, varied discussions, and active userbase. But we already have a Reddit-clone here, but we *do* have a lack of news and discussions. And all the news sites inevitably point back to clearnet. I've also noticed a huge lack of images/pictures here. Is it because there's not really a need? Or because there's not a platform to upload pictures?

Let's say that when content is published, all the reachable peers have reached their space limit, will the content never publish ?\n\nWell it's always published on your computer. If users reject to raise their limit (it'll prompt you, or you  can do it manually by dragging the top right icon to the left and changing the value), then they just won't sync AFAIK. Each user has a set limit, which I think can be adjusted by the site owner. Sites themselves aren't actually limited to a particular size, but IIRC anything over 10mb has a prompt.

Kaffeine's is a clone of zerosearch with slight changes in the source code and fewer indexed sites, I'm not sure why anyone would prefer it to zerosearch.\n> Bwoi doesn't look like it has been updated in a while, but it does have an original source code. It only has 139 results though, around half as many results as ZeroSearch.\n\nZeroSearch was the first one. It uses a mix of a central authority list filled by it's dev, along with a collection of dev approved user submissions. At the moment, the index count is wrong, since there's several sites indexed multiple times. IMO it's not very functional, but it was what we had to work with for a long time.\n\nKaffiene (my search engine) is indeed a clone of zerosearch. I removed the user-submission aspect, since it just queued them up without adding. However, when I finished cloning it, Kaffiene had an identical amount of sites. I then took the liberty of adding a few more. I noticed earlier today ZeroSearch added quite a few as well. IMO, Kaffiene is more usable, and provides more or less all the same sites.\n\nBwoi is a new one that only indexes and searches the ZeroName sites.\n\nPerhaps I'm biased, but I'd say usability goes: Kaffiene > ZeroSearch > Bwoi.\n\nEither way, I'm planning on continually updating Kaffiene with new features/results. I'm currently looking into how to automatically grab new sites to index. As always, I intend to keep functionality and quality search results as a top priority for Kaffiene.

How is that worse than your current way of receiving sites through zeromail?\n\nIt's not. A user request system is nice, but it's ultimately useless. There's no reason to have a queue system that's mostly for the dev of the site taking up bandwidth and site storage space. It'd work better if users of the site could vote on 'good' sites. But as it stands, that entire functionality is useless without an active dev. There's the implication that the queue is autochecked when it's not. Making it more or less the same as the other sites.\n\nPersonally, I removed this because it's dishonest (the queue is equivalent to just asking the dev to add the site) and it takes up space. it also makes the site clunkier. It's not a fault for having it, but I just see no point in it. ZeroSearch honestly has much bigger problems than doing something with the queue system.",

Those millions of people who just want to click a button and have their content appear on the page. Markdown is fine, as we see people on reddit use it just fine despite having no coding experience. However, how many of those users would, say, be comfortable digging into the html and javascript of a site to customize it? Hell, even a lot of reddit *moderators* don't care to do that and just copy+paste important stuff they like (full themes, generators for stuff, etc).\n\nAnd back in the day with myspace we saw a similar thing happen.

I mean: in my country torrenting is illegal, so I always have to use a proxy to use my torrent client. Is this also necessary here in ZeroNet? are the real IPs shared somewhere? Is there any extra precaution I should take?\n> Thanks\n\nZeroNet does not hide traffic. Which is why there's included  Tor support, and if you're overly cautious, you might want to use a VPN. Though I'm confused. You say 'torrenting is illegal'. Do you mean the protocol itself? Even companies like Blizzard and Microsoft use torrents to distribute their software and updates. And plenty of legal content is distributed through it. On top of that,  torrents themselves can be used for plenty of legal activities, like browsing ZeroNet.\n\nIf you're *actually* questioning about 'Play', then treat those torrents exactly as you would torrents you get on the clearnet. Because that's literally what they are: reposted magnet links. They seem to be all Rarbg links. So if you use a VPN or w/e for those, then you'll obviously want to use it for the movies you get off Play.\n\nZeroNet itself does not actually torrent the movies. Unless, of course, a movie is included as part of a website that you connect to (at which point the site would take a long time to load). It also wouldn't be prey to the typical ways that companies catch people torrenting (through looking at the IP swarm), since ZeroNet is it's own network and doesn't connect to people outside of it.\n\nIf you're planning on using ZeroNet itself (not using it to mirror links) to do illegal things, then you might want to get extra protection.",

If we make search plugin for zeronet (python) it can indexes all user sites ( sites what user seeds) and broadcast index to DHT network (like yacy do) and that plugin should have zero api, so if you want to find some information in network you send request to DHT and recursively find what you want (like yacy do). \n\nThis won't happen. I was talking with nofish about crawling sites. He doesn't want anything that could automatically 'reveal' sites that may be intentionally hidden. So any sort of crawling, or DHT searching, or w/e is off limits. Which means a few things: 1) it won't ever be included as a python script, meaning it has to be JS, or a separate download. 2) It won't have native support, meaning that the results would be inherently limited. 3) There's still no way to grab content, making the search practically useless.\n\nI think the actual future of the search engines is probably going to be merger-sites, where various site indexes link out their list of sites, search engines grab and merge those, and then search through them.

Regular movie torrents from play didn't seem to work with my test, but I dunno if that was just shoddy example code, a shoddy connection, or just a bad torrent. Or if it legit didn't work with those torrents. The web torrent site says you need special \"webrtc enabled\" torrents in order for them to work. And those torrents need to be seeded by a 'webrtc enabled' client. Of which there's seems to basically be none.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it didn't at all store the file on my computer after the test. Presumably it was in the cache. Seeding doesn't happen after the user leaves the page. So all stuff would either have to be explicitly seeded with an external app, or the users would have to remain on the page while they seed.\n\nThis would be fine if lots of people were accessing the content, like popular movies on play. It's not so good for a video sharing site like youtube or vimeo which might have unpopular videos.\n\nIf it worked for regular torrents (my quick test showed it didn't), then it'd be brilliant for it. Just have the users upload magnet links/torrents, and then stream them. You can already do this with regular torrents, along with a streaming client like Playback.\n\nIPFS seems like a better way to go, but I found it was *really* slow to stream content. I dunno if that was because I didn't set it up right, or if it was just legit slow.\n\nPersonally, I like the idea of *regular* torrents, so that users can freely use a torrent client of their choice, or use the built in one. But AFAIK there's no JS tool to stream them yet.",

Talking about cryptocurrencies was rather misleading.\n> I basically want to try and create turn based games, using internal messaging (like ZeroChat) to publicly update the state of the game to players and observers.\n> For my purpose it sounds like I can just have players use an incremental move number (0, 1, 2, etc), and if a player tries to cheat by sending \"double moves\" they will have to have signed both moves, which I guess could be detected and then the player will be considered forfeit by everyone watching the game.\n\nAh, this is completely doable. You can either just have the client check the moves and only display the latest/earliest (much like how [ZeroWiki](http://127.0.0.1:43110/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:home) only displays the latest update). Or you can use a server backend that visitors send messages to in order to submit their move. Something like ZeroID (to register unique names) or ZeroBoard (send messages to server which then posts for you).\n\nJust do this as you would any regular HTML/JS app, or introduce a python/php/etc backend if needed (though that removes the decentralization).\n\nDouble spend is still  an issue, obviously. Since the blockchain/bitcoin is the first solution to that problem. Cryptocurrencies are unique because they guarantee that the coin is unique and unable to be spent twice with no central authority. You either need a central authority to validate, or you need to trust the users (either client). The nature of ZeroNet allows someone to delete or change the content they've uploaded at any time. So that wouldn't really work well for a game, since cheating could happen. So you're probably stuck with either centrally checking it, or figuring out some other solution. Perhaps you could do a 'move verification' thing. Have 3 players in a game, and then make sure 2 of the 3 sign off on a move for it to be accepted. Bitcoin market places do this to ensure transactions aren't scams and to ensure things don't mess up.",

But that requires site owners to participate.\n\nSo far, all the search engines (with the exception of Zearch) simply use curated tags. But perhaps there's a better solution. We'll see.",

				"body": "> if it would be feasible to open a torrent site akin to kickasstorrents on zeronet with minimal hardware investment.\n\nThere's already a site like this: [ZeroTorrent.bit](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zerotorrent.bit). And yes, all websites on ZeroNet require minimal hardware, since the hosting is decentralized.\n\n>I'm asking because I find it hard to imagine how a site with a 'large amount' of user generated content can be decentralized.\n\nDepends on how much you're talking about. For reference, the pirate bay database comes in at 700mb or so, and contains: \"names, descriptions, comments, seeder and leecher info, date of upload, size info and quality marks (only for some torrents, before before TPB took it down).\" Remove the extra information and leave the magnet links and titles and you get down to 75mb. That's more than small enough to host on ZeroNet. Albeit, you'll likely need to use the 'optional files' feature that allows visitors to download/seed only some of the files (stuff viewed).\n\n>Ideally the site owner should not need to be online constantly for the site to run normally (only to update features or fix bugs).\n\nYup, ZeroTorrent is already like that.\n\n>So in order for the users to be able to login and add content without the 'central server', the user database would have to be available to every peer. In order not to compromise the privacy of the users it must be possible for every user to encrypt his own private user data into this user database. Also as admin of the site one might want to also look in on some of this private data. So maybe the private user data needs to be also encrypted using the site owners public key as a duplicate.\n\n>Is something like that feasible or a pipe dream?\n\nYou're essentially describing how the DB system works for ZeroNet sites in general. Keep in mind the 'login and add content' is something you literally just did here on ZeroTalk. Instead of a question, all you'd have to do is post a magnet link and some info. To quickly summarize how it works, each user has permission to upload a 'data.json' file with their contributions to the site. These json files are aggregated into an SQLite database which is then accessed by the site. Each user's contributions are only able to be modified by the user (and perhaps the site owner). And there's even options to make them completely encrypted private, like in the case of ZeroMail.",

It's a python script running on a centralized/dedicated host that essentially acts as another user (such as the site's owner).  I actually have been toying with the concept of decentralized crawlers for my search engine [Kaffiene.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffiene.bit) Though unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a reliable way of doing that.

				"body": "Yea, I've heard of yacy. Obviously decentralized search engines (for anything) is possible if you have people running code for it. The issue is using ZeroNet as a platform to do that. The javascript for each site is ran like a typical website. Once you leave the site, the code no longer runs. See [ZeroTube](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FUQPLXHimgCvYHH7v3bJXspJ7bMBUXcEb) for why that's an issue. The videos magnet links get uploaded, and while the user is on the page it seeds through webtorrent. But once they leave, the video becomes unseeded and effectively dead. On top of that, there doesn't seem to be a way to escape the site's sandbox, making it impossible to crawl clearnet for stuff anyway (not that users would agree, as many come to zeronet as an alternative web).\n\nYacy is able to do what it does because it runs in the background while users visit regular web pages. It logs that activity and crawls the visited pages. I thought up a similar idea for kaffiene: grab the user's list of seeded sites. Unfortunately this solutions was cockblocked by nofish, as grabbing a list of seeded sites is only for admin/official sites, making it impossible to use otherwise. For a torrent crawler, this method wouldn't work at all.\n\nOne solution might be to have a python script, or zeronet plugin that users can download and set up, that helps crawl for torrents or w/e else. They'd still be posted in the user-driven way, but it'd be automated. Perhaps that'd work?\n\nEither way, the big thing is that websites don't really have a backend here. It's just a frontend that's decentrally hosted. So trying to do backend stuff is likely going to have to be centralized (or you could come up with your own decentralized backend separate from zeronet).",

You can technically move the Zeronet folder itself to another location, but your site still has to be stored in /Zeronet/data or w/e.

Then run `brew install tor` to download/install the tor daemon (they have a mac app for the browser, but just ignore that). After it's done downloading and installing, navigate to the `/usr/local/etc/tor` folder on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to open finder and hit `cmd+shift+g` and paste it in there. You should see a `torrc.sample` file. Copy that and rename the copy to just `torrc` with no extension. Open it up in a text editor (presumably a plain text one like [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to prevent auto-formatting from messing it up. Avoid using mac's built-in one.) Look for `#ControlPort 9051` and simply remove the \\#. Two lines down you should see `#CookieAuthentication 1` remove the \\# from this one too. After that, save up and launch tor using `tor start` in the terminal. After this, restart zeronet and it'll run with tor. If you want to use tor for every connection (rather than just having one for a bridge or to access tor-only peers) then on the zero net homepage, click on the tor button in the top right, and hit 'enable tor for every connection' at the bottom. Then restart zeronet. You can disable it in the same way.\n\nHope that helps. That's how I got mine set up. No torbrowser though, if you wanted to use that.\n\nEdit: I converted this quick walkthrough into [a guide over on my blog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit/?Post:22:New+blog+post) Please share that rather than this post when sharing how to do this.

If we're going to have taxes used on *anything*, guarantee basic necessities are covered for all humans before doing it. Why support roads and the automobile industry, when you can let the industry build it's own damn roads and instead support food/water/shelter for people and rely less harmful transport like walking/biking/subways? Why spend trillions on a military whose only job is to *kill people*, when instead you could be providing those same people with food/water/shelter?\n\nIt's nonsensical to me that we spend our taxes on *anything*, while there's still people starving to death and lack shelter (despite shelter being a legal necessity!!!)",

Users might be posting to several hubs, but joining multiple hubs has caused problems for ZeroMe.  I think Kaffie has said the problems are mainly due to design flaws in ZeroMe; maybe a categorized site is possible now.\n\nThe issue isn't with the hubs. The hubs are just collections of data. The issue that happen(ed/s) with posting in multiple hubs is the display logic that ZeroMe uses. it assumes stuff from 'posts' only comes from a single hub, where in reality it can come from multiple. All you'd really have to do is keep the multiple hubs distinctly separate, rather than assuming that only one can have posts.\n\n'joining a hub' is really just planting down the posts/bio/avatar/etc. info on that particular hub. For a generic torrent site, the 'posts' would be submissions, and would be properly categorized into the various hubs. There wouldn't be a conflict, since they'd be explicitly in different categories (hubs). What ZeroMe does is treat all the comments/likes/posts/etc. as if they're all one big zerome site.

				"body": ">Does anybody have a good explaination for how merger sites such as ZeroMe work?\n\nThe merger feature is broken up into two parts: A hub site which contains only data. And a viewer/merger site which grabs multiple hub sites and 'merges' them. You can replace either part: you can keep the same hub sites and replace the viewer, or keep the viewer and replace the hub sites.\n\n>If I am seeding a hub, am I by default able to view it in ZeroMe?\n\nYes. Any hub you're seeding, you can view in ZeroMe (provided, of course, that it's a zerome hub).\n\n>When I post something, does it go to the first hub I joined, or does it go to all of them?\n\nWhen you join a hub, that hub gets initialized with your profile and post data. When you post something, it goes to the hub that you initialized. There's currently a bug where if you initialized two different hubs, things will glitch. You can see which hub it'll post to by looking at the link to your profile, it'll contain the hubsite address.\n\n>If it only goes to one hub, am I able to switch which hub I post to?\n\nThere is no official way to do this, no. I wrote a guide on how to manually switch hubs [here.](kaffie.bit/?Post:25:How+to+change+your+ZeroMe+Hub) Though if you have existing followers, ZeroMe will glitch a bit. The lack of switching hubs is purely due to how ZeroMe works, and not an issue with the merger/hub feature.\n\n>Am I only allowed to have a profile on one hub or do I have a profile on all of my hubs?\n\nThe profile, as mentioned earlier is stored in your initialized hub. There's nothing technically stopping you from including this data on the other hubs. However, the ZeroMe merger site isn't written to support this, and glitches. ZeroMe expects you to have a profile on only a single hub. And indeed, there's no real benefit to having a profile on different hubs. For merger sites in general, a 'profile' isn't actually a part of the API. So you can forego it altogether, or allow users to make 'posts' on every hub (just like they can with comments).\n\n>Can I comment on somebody's post from a different hub? What happens if they aren't seeding the particular hub that I joined first? What would happen?\n\nYes, this is the whole point of a merger site. Your posts on other hubs are stored in your user folder on that site. If you are commenting on a post that's on a different hub, your comment will be viewable to anyone seeding that hub (which is the same group of people able to see the parent post). If, however, they are only seeding your home hub, and not the other hub, they won't be able to see the post. People only see content that's posted on/to hubs they are seeding. Comments and likes are stored in the hub they're commented/liked on. So if someone can see the post, they can see the likes and comments.",

				"body": "ZeroNet uses .bit domains resolved through a ZeroNet site. The default resolver is [zeroname.bit.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zeroname.bit) ZeroName gathers it's list by connecting to the [Namechain](http://namecha.in/) website and grabbing a list of valid ZeroNet names.\n\nZeroNet also has an option to resolve using a local copy of Namecoin, or to configure your own domain name site.\n\nBy obtaining a domain name for your site, the links shorten to something like [http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit) Still long, but much shorter. As you may have been aware with ZeroMe, you can see that the domain name has made it a bit shorter. The extra stuff at the end is site-specific parameters, which varies from site to site.\n\n---\n\nThe big issue, then, is the ugly localhost:port at the beginning. There's two ways of fixing this, and neither are official. The first is to either download the [ZeroNet chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zeronet-protocol/cpkpdcdljfbnepgfejplkhdnopniieop?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog), which is semi-officially supported (stuff like ZeroMe adjusts for it). Or you can head over to the [kaffie.bit protocol test page](http://127.0.0.1/kaffie.bit/test.html) and download the .pac proxy file to configure the `http://zero/<address>` style urls along with direct http://name.bit support.\n\nThere's also an option on that page to configure the `zero://` protocol, which is entirely unofficial, but cleans up links a lot (the end result is: `zero://kaffie.bit`). However, the way this protocol is handled only works on firefox (and likely clones), and doesn't clean up the url bar, it just makes links look nicer (which is pointless if people can't resolve them).\n\nThe big issue with both methods is that the purpose of clean links is to share them. However, neither the `http://zero/` nor the `zero://` methods are official, and thus not all users have them (again, refer to the test page to see which work for you). Hell, even the localhost:port bit becomes non-standard, with the presence of proxies and people customizing their port. Ultimately there's not really a clean solution to all of this, and it remains to be one of ZeroNet's biggest problems.",

Best you can do is treat it and move on.\n\n>It's a mental disorder, linked to a small but consistent abnormality in the brain, and like most mental disorders and illnesses (i.e. clinical depression) there isn't a cure either, only treatment.\n\nNo. It's not. Gender dysphoria, as described in the DSM-V is a mental illness, not a disorder. It's not linked to any abnormality in the brain, but rather an improper responding to sexed hormones. Which is why it's treated with hormone replacement. And yes, it's been cured. This is the type of idiocy I was talking about.\n\n> I could point you to a dozen books written by certified, professional psychiatrists, but they all say the same thing: avoidance and denial are absolutely, completely ineffective at treating anyone with a mental disorder: anxiety, PTSD, eating disorders, whatever.\n\nI don't disagree. I'm well read on psychology and mental health. Gender dysphoria, and being trans, are not a mental disorder.\n\n>And indulging in a disorder, i.e. normalizing suicide, or chemically and surgically imitating the opposite sex hurts people, badly, and permanently, and it's absolutely reprehensible for any medical professional to permit it.\n\nGreat strawman right here. No. Transitioning, hormone replacement, and surgery do *not* make people worse off. What makes people worse off is ignoring the problem. There's a reason untreated trans people have a 40% suicide rate while post-op reduces that dramatically.\n\n> So you know what my soon-to-be wife and I do, concerning dysphoria?\n\nSolve the problem? It's pretty straight forward, and treatment works almost immediately.\n\n>Find an effective therapist, learn to live with it, not reject it, or indulge in it, \n\nHave fun with that, I'd rather not live my life eternally depressed. Thanks. You do realize talk therapy doesn't help with a hormone problem, right? And that it simply gets worse with age?\n\n>and stay away from incredibly reckless practices like hormone therapy and surgery, the kinds of things that ruin people's lives.\n\nExcept it has an 80%+ satisfaction rate. One of the highest in medicine. If transitioning is 'reckless and ruins people's lives' then certainly all medicine and medical treatment must. Given everything else has a lower satisfaction rate.\n\n>Because you know what kind of people are able to accept their problematic circumstances, recognize reality, and endeavor to be happy despite it? Grown up, fucking adults.\n\nGrown fucking adults don't deny science and reality in favor of fantasies of \"I'll just get over it magically\".",

In most cases this means only trans or intersex people will get it, but there have been cases where cis people have gotten it for a variety of reasons (side effects of other drugs, forcefully transitioned, willfully transitioned, etc).

You literally do a brain transplant ala the one coming up? I think trans people in general would be pretty excited at that.\n\n> How do you think they would feel about that?What if they are stuck like that for the rest of there life?\n\nIf you did such a brain transplant on a cis (not trans) person, they'll almost certainly experience gender dysphoria due to conflicting hormones and anatomy. There's been quite a few cases that demonstrate this. The most famous is [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) who's a cis guy that was forcefully transitioned.\n\n> There brains are healthy, and the bodies are healthy, so what is the problem exactly?\n\nThis is the case for trans people. The issue is the gender/sex conflict. The brain expects a certain physiology and certain hormones. Examples unrelated to sex would be stuff like phantom limb syndrome.\n\n> The sexually dysmorphic differences in a body happen due to the sex hormone balance at multiple stages of a persons life.For many things, once developed, it is \"set\", meaning that changing the balance later wont change it much or at all.\n\nMost development happens within the womb and then later at puberty. Pubertal changes can sometimes be undone (depending on the exact trait/change we're talking about). But yes, several sex traits can't be undeveloped (voice, breasts, reproductive organs, genitals, etc).\n\n>The brain is sexually dysmorphic (why wouldn't it be?) and while it has much plasticity, it also has parts that have little or no plasticity.\n\nSure. The brain is pretty complicated as it is.\n\n> In the womb, humans start off female and are either left to develop as a female, or switched to male with a timed testosterone dump.The amount of testosterone in the dump, and the timing can be off, resulting in anomalies, like a brain that developed female in a body that developed male.\n\nYes. This is the current theory as to the cause of trans identities.\n\n> Biologically, males and females are almost identical, if you change a persons testo/estro balance during childhood to the opposite of there sex, they will develop into the opposite of there sex, voice, appearance, size and all.\n\nIndeed. Once outside of the womb, besides already developed differences, the presence of external hormones can cause the body to develop in either direction. This is why transitioning often times works much better for younger people.",

This alone tells me the poster has no clue how ZeroNet works, nor what the risks are of running it. The DNS is based on namecoin, which is as safe and decentralized as bitcoin. If you have a problem with namecoin, you sure as fuck have a problem with ICANN, since namecoin is demonstrably more reliable and safe than ICANN. You can 100% guarantee that the site you're looking for is the site you get, and not someone who did a DNS hijack, or an ICANN official mucking things up.\n\nI don't use ICANN. Fuck them. OpenNIC for regular web, and namecoin for dark web. Anything else and you're opening yourself up to security risks.\n\n>For example, White Van material (talking about CP here) has been found encoded into EXIF data in seemingly benign pictures. Android had a HUGE insecurity where just viewing an image on your phone ran a script behind the scenes and you would never have known.\n\nThe issue with android is a bigger issue on the clear web, as images can come from anywhere and be automatically ran. ZeroNet prevents cross-site embedding, which means only sites you trust can load images or content.\n\n>You cannot, I repeat CANNOT browse or use a webpage while you are offline. \n\nYes you can. I often browse ZeroNet while offline. In fact, you can *only* view pages 'offline'. Page content is not streamed, it's downloaded and then viewed. ZeroNet just saves it instead of cache.\n\n>However, AJAX won't work\n\nAJAX works fine on ZeroNet, though it's obviously not encouraged.\n\n>HTTP requests and responses won't work, \n\nThey do. Only to sites that have been set to view offline.\n\n>links won't work\n\nThey do. Again, you can certainly use a search engine like Kaffiene, and then click a link to a site and visit it, all offline.\n\n> refreshes and updates won't work.\n\nThey do. You can refresh the page, and updates from you or anyone on your lan (once support is done ;P) work fine. Obviously you can't receive updates from the internet without being online. Duh.\n\n>OP is directing people to a link (I'm not posting it). If anyone asks a question, OP replies and attempts to answer by saying \"just download the link\". I don't need to explain why that would be monumentally stupid in doing so.\n\nYeah, it's really dumb to download and run stuff without knowing what it is. But that's like saying \"if someone tells you to download and run firefox, don't do it because you're dumb!\" ZeroNet is completely safe.\n\n>digitally signed, and secured so that information at rest and during transmission isn't being tampered with. \n\nActually, you can't get that guarantee with the clear web. You guarantee it with ZeroNet.\n\n> You can't verify that what is being handed to you isn't malicious or that executables aren't embedded in them. \n\nActually, that's true of the clear web, not zeronet. 'google.com' on the clear web could point you to a malicious site due to a variety of reasons. But kaffiene.bit on zeronet will *guarantee* you get the right files coded and signed by yours truly. But yes, just like the internet in general, you can't guarantee that any particular user will not host malicious files. That goes for both clear web and zeronet.\n\n>Once they have been received by your system, they don't go away when you delete Zeronet\n\nOh for fucks sake. ZeroNet is entirely self-contained. If there's any exploit, it's due to your browser, and thus you're equally as vulnerable on the clear web, if not more so due to the previous flaws mentioned.\n\n>Say goodbye to HTTPS, SSH, TLS, or any other standardized and ubiquitous security measure when you use Zeronet because you're pulling your information from an adjacent node, not a server.\n\nSure, but you don't need them. All the files are guaranteed to be correct by math.\n\n>TOR is not secured, either. \n\nTor is not zeronet.\n\nThis guy is clearly clueless about how ZeroNet works, or why it's *more* secure than the clear web, not less.",

I take an estrogen supplement (in the form of estradiol), along with an anti-androgen (spironolactone). The estrogen is used for the obvious reasons, to raise my estrogen levels up the proper female levels. The anti-androgen is used to *lower* testosterone down to female levels. From there, the body naturally develops how it should, and female characteristics properly develop. There's a huge list of stuff that happens. Skin changes, sweat, fat distribution, breasts, hair growth, some shrinking, certain things stop growing, body hair changes, etc, etc. There's also a whole host of mental effects, which have benefited me greatly, including relieving my anxiety.\n\nLike wise, trans guys go the other way. They take testosterone injections (no need for an estrogen suppressant), and develop male characteristics as they properly should: facial hair, muscle/bone growth, body hair, fat distributions, sweat, skin changes, etc, etc. Though I'm not too knowledgeable about this direction, since I've never had the need to look into it.",

It's not exactly like you can just ignore the legal system and assume nothing will go wrong. I do think opting out of society as much as possible should be the current goal. And focusing on making free decentralized systems so that the current legal and monetary systems are unneeded. The less support mainstream society has, the easier it'll be to get rid of it. I talked a bit about this on my blog, but I definitely need to do some more in-depth writing. Unfortunately I don't think opting out completely without societal support will ever be possible, as long as you have medical needs or desire new tech.\n\nWhat we really need to get anarchism off the ground and going is lots of funding and resources. Building up networks of anarchist communities, and focusing on cutting ties with major systems. I think ZeroNet can be a key piece of this in terms of tech. No need for dedicated webhosts, no need for ICANN, no big corp tracking or spying, etc. Unfortunately the hardware and physical aspect of it all is much more difficult than the digital portion.

But if I send you, a distant comrade a letter asking for food because my child is sick, I should not offer gifts (gifts makes us slaves).  I have nothing to trade.  What I offer is my humanity and solidarity.  My word, a letter of love.   That is my money.   Everything is symbolic/gestures/tokens, language itself , before things can materialise.    Currency today I agree, it should be abolished.   But I also think there is a missunderstanding about that too. The point I wanted to make was really about profit, money (as in currency can exist without profit).  Its still a ransom to work, but profiit (like interest) was never always the result of money -  in middle eastern societies before capitalism, prices were determined buy the community, not the buyer or the seller.  And never for profit. \n\nYou can't buy or sell something without ownership or property. As long as you have ownership and/or tokens representing such, you will always have people who try to maximize how much they have. Regardless of the systems in place.\n\n> Q) Should anarchists support bitcoin or decry it?\n\nIt's a step up from the current monetary system. And the blockchain itself can be a useful way of assigning names and numbers (see namecoin which is great). I do not think access should be restricted based on bitcoin (or namecoin). I think a UBI implementation like [duniter](https://en.duniter.org/) would be a better option to support, if you're looking to replace money but still keep it.\n\n> Funding?  By that I assume you mean 'stealing' (taking back what is ours to take), especially given your first comment about money ;)\n\nIdeally funding and resources would be obtained peacefully, rather than aggravating the rest of society. It's important to have a good image. There's also the issue of legal theft deprives someone else of their access. Which is anti-anarchistic. It would not be an issue in an anarchy, as the person 'deprived' could simply take it back, or take something else they need. But within current society, most people do not want to get on the bad side of the militarized police. You're free to do so, but I don't think that'll be the fastest way of demonstrating a minimal viable product. To properly kickstart an anarchy you'd need *lots* of resources. Land, some sort of farm for food production, technology, shelter, water, electricity, etc. The more the better. Imagine managing to make an anarchic city. Go anywhere in the city and it's still good. Showing that living without money is possible will make people quick to ditch their slave labor which will then crumble the system. Trying to fight the law first will only result in anarchists being perceived as 'hoodlums' and criminals, rather than as people who want to build a better and more functional society.\n\nThis is why I have no problem advocating copyright infringement, but I'm more iffy on depriving people of things, and aggravating police. If you saw during Trump's inaugeration, some people calling themselves anarchists were breaking windows, knocking over trash cans, and lighting cars on fire. While that *was* a demonstration of rejecting the legal system, I doubt many people would look at that and go \"I want to be like them.\" But if, instead, you show them a city of people living and not needing to work, opting in where they can best improve the city, and generally living with modern luxuries, that's more attractive and will get people supporting the cause.\n\nRobbing the rich is fine. They don't feel it anyway. Robbing from the middle class and poor results in the deprivation of access being felt, and should be a no-go. That's my 2c on the topic.",

Namecoin IS money. \n\nThis is kind of a complicated issue. On one hand, private ownership of a name/password/etc. is pretty much needed for online services to work and be convenient. On the other, owning a name or namecoin is indeed 'money' and thus enforced ownership. I think namecoin isn't really the way to go, even though it works *much* better than current DNS systems. I can see a type of namecoin blockchain popping up that has the UBI properties of duniter. Or maybe just ditching domain names altogether (though that might be difficult for non-tech people). As for web pages, yes. People should be free to be able to manage their own websites. Much like how it's done here on ZeroNet. You can easily clone a site, look at the source code, modify your locally downloaded copy, etc. So it's not like the content is 'owned'. And there'd certainly be no copyright. So really the only thing you could say is \"ownership of the ability to access content associated with a particular public key\". At which point I'd argue that it's not owned, but merely accessed by one person who's the only person who knows how to access it. If someone else got their hands on the private key, there'd be no issue with them modifying the site. Privacy =/= ownership. But this is certainly something I'd need to think more about, and talk about with other anarchists.\n\n>I agree we shouldnt own materials and have private property.  But I think you missunderstand my point.  UBI is a terrible idea because not only does it still allow the capitalists to control the means of production, it also doesnt give people the leverage of being able to withdraw their labour, and UBI could be cut back at the whim of the capitalists -  leaving many without any income or leverage to demand it back.   Its also why UBI is popular among the right wing capitalists as much as with the socialists.  Some corporate lobbyists are promoting UBI because its a distraction from the fact they own the property and means of production, it  grants them all the power of the state and resources and production in exchange for charity to the unemployed.\n\nOh I agree. I don't mean to say UBI is the end-all be-all system. I'm saying for transitional purposes, it's very useful. It helps remove the reliance on wage slavery. Again, refer to duniter for a good example of how I imagine a transitional currency.\n\n>Duniter means you only get income if you own a computer and own/purchase coins. \n\nIn duniter you don't 'purchase coins'. They're generated continuously and evenly distributed among the users. The inflation involved automatically equalizes older users and newer users, as well as the rich and poor. It's designed to be able to be used for transactions, while also keeping wealth and income equality over long periods of time. And yes, it's limited to people who have a computer and have opted-in, because this obviously isn't a government currency, and it's exclusively digital (like most money nowadays).\n\n>Theres nothing remotely anarchist about that.\n\nI didn't say there was. I don't think currency in any form is anarchist. I'm simply describing what I see as a useful transitional currency in order to *arrive* at anarchism.\n\n>Its still designed to be exclusive only to people who have the means to access it.  It is libertarianism, which to my mind is the worse of all systems.  I appreciate the intent is good.  But capitalism cannot be reformed.  Its just another variant of socialism trying to slow the worse excesses of capitalism.  But it isnt going to lead to anarchy.  We need to reject ALL forms of capitalism.\n\nI see socialism as the way to get to anarchism. By making existing systems more easily accessible without using pure cash, you decrease the reliance on currency, and thus make it easier to eliminate. I'm curious how you intend to arrive at a stable anarchism with a smooth transition, if you simply reject socialism and general attempts at removing reliance on capitalism. Violent riots/revolutions don't tend to work. Look at countries that tried that. They almost always end up with a similar style of government, and not actually anarchism.",

If you destroy property of banks (who are theives) or fight fascist police it actually effects them and may actually help other comrades, but you will not paint a good image of yourself.\n\nThere's a difference between short-term results and long-term ideological shifts. I'm focused more on the long-game, which will actually lead to major changes, rather than short-term which will just draw some small attention and not really do anything in the long run. Smashing a window doesn't actually help anyone to begin living in an anarchy.\n\n> You will NEVER get this without giving a bad image and stealing it.  The media controls how anarchists are percieved.  Nothing you do will make a differnce to how you are portrayed in the eyes of the public. And if you want resources you MUST take it, there is no alternative. It is never going to be handed to you.  Capitalists 'own' everything.\n\nAgain, you're confusing short-term gains with long-term movements. Stealing something does literally nothing. Things are stolen every day. It does nothing to change the political/economic climate to an anarchy. No amount of looting or violent resisting of police will end up, say, making every building freely accessible. That will only come from society itself changing.\n\n> This would be great.   Its what happend in catalonia.  All of those anarchists fought non peacefully to get it.  And they are not portrayed as people with a good image  today, even as most of the world today acknowledges Franco was an evil fascist.\n\nRight. Some sources will always paint anarchism in a bad light. But the more working examples we have, the easier it'll be to point to and say \"hey look, this works.\"\n\n> No I don t think they would say that either.  So?  You need to understand the black block movement.  Its a tactic for actually doing stuff that effects the system and allowing other protests (even non anarchists) to protest and act in other effectual ways whilst distracting the cops.    Do you think marching up and down a predetermined route helps?   The Womens March in DC last week was a distraction from the call for an actual womens global strike on that day  (which would have been way way more effective - revolutionary id say - see   http://www.womenstrike.org/  (the media didnt even acknowledge this call by women)    Thats why the media promoted the weekend march so much, to drown it out.   It does fuck all harm to them by comparison. And gives women an outlet that is mostly harmless to them.  Withdrawing labour is the only way to destroy capitalism.  Captalism will always exist while we still provide labour for them.  A weekend march doesnt touch them .  As a defiant act of self expression, it has some value (it potentially helps push the theory that we should change the system along a little).  But does nothing to actually change the system. \n\nRight. Demonstrations do nothing. What actually helps is systemic change. Not just a temper tantrum but a viable solution that works and will actually impact society in a major way.\n\n> Of course, but HOW do you get that city in the first place without TAKING it?\n\nThat's certainly a good question. One way is to just buy it out, participating in capitalism. I lived in a city like that, owned by a single company. Another way is to simply convert everyone in that particular city over to anarchism. Remember, the point is to get people agree with and participate in anarchism. Not attack people and try to attack existing countries. The big problem is that many supply chains are based around the world and are heavily entrenched in capitalism. A violent reaction where we cut ourselves off and claim a small block or neighborhood or something is functionally useless. Kicking people out doesn't help. We need them to simply readjust their work for anarchism instead of capitalism.\n\n> [thisweb11](#comment_312_1D9w8AJTfqmn26iT2kF81B8HxXFfycXuXM): Why do you think its important to go to space when we can't even roam the countryside outside our back gate without capitalists permission?  I'd say getting to space is the least important goal in the history of humanity.   Its only  importance is one of fun, the pleasure of discovery itself.   But that makes it extremely low on the list of things we need to do when I can't even walk in the woods without a fine.\n\nBelieve it or not, making space habitable will do a lot to help push anarchist and decentralist values. The point of, say, colonizing mars is for the systems that are built. Food, water, shelter, etc. all easily available in a place that doesn't really have that stuff. On top of that, pushing for other-world colonization can be one way of kickstarting anarchism. Just simply not on earth. The moon, mars, etc. are all international and not all that regulated. Meaning it's the perfect testbed for anarchism. It's not *as* important, but I still see it as a good goal to have in terms of political views. As it stands, I'd *much* rather have the $600billion/year military budget spent on space/nasa, than on killing people.\n\n> [thisweb11](#comment_313_1D9w8AJTfqmn26iT2kF81B8HxXFfycXuXM): Agree it is complicated.   ( I recommend anarchist David Graeber's book: Dept the first 5000 years which discusses the meaning of money at length)   Ive thought about this a lot and don't think its quite right to say anarchists must not use money.  Ownership of resources and private property is different to privacy and possessions. I think there are kinds of money that have a similar dichotomy of meaning that many anarchist fail to grasp. \n\nI cannot think of a single way to fairly distribute a currency and ownership without there being bias and a tendency to hoard and cause a growth economy. As well as to enforce those things. If you have ownership, you need a violent body to enforce that ownership (otherwise someone else could just take the thing). And by doing that you now have a government that decides who owns what. And thus you no longer have anarchism and capitalism will naturally arise.\n\n> OK.  Thats interesting I need to look into that more.  I think I missunderstood. How are they distributed and to who? , how is it decided who gets how many?  \n\nIt's all automatic based on the software. [See here for the theory behind it.](http://cuckooland.free.fr/TheRtmForTheKids.html) Everyone who's a 'member' of the software (actually using it and confirmed to be a unique human by the community) gets a portion of the newly generated currency. The amount generated is based on the current amount in circulation. Say, 10% (I think duniter has it at like 9.something). So every time new money is generated, it's 10% of the total amount in circulation, and that amount is then evenly distributed among members. This means there's continually rising inflation to equalize the the amount everyone has over time.\n\n> But we still have to actually get hold of resources to use this currency and thats what really matters, because if we have those resources we dont need the currency!\n\nRight. As I said, I think currency as a whole needs to be gotten rid of. But UBI is useful for remedying the current situation that capitalism has gotten us into.\n\n> Socialism hinders anarchy, if it didnt exist the capitalists would have needed to  invent it.  In fact thats why colonial countries like the UK adopted lots of marxist ideas (welfare, free schooling and eventually NHS) , anarchism was popular at around the same time, they were terrified of it.  Soft Marxism was used to appease an impending revolt and it held back the anarchists.  It does so to this day.\n\nThat's actually pretty interesting. I don't have any formal education in this stuff, and am simply sharing my thoughts on it all (and trying to keep up with terminology). Personally I still don't think the two are conflicting. I think socialism is a useful way of getting aspects of anarchism into capitalism without necessarily overthrowing the entire thing right away. For instance, I go through medicaid for health insurance and don't pay a dime. Exactly how it'd be in an anarchy. Likewise, I have a phone on a similar system. I don't pay for cell service. These systems let me opt out of capitalism in those fields. If you manage to do this with everything, you can completely opt out of wage slavery, albeit still be tied to a government. I definitely agree it reduces the 'need' for people to go to anarchism. But as I said, I see it as perhaps the fastest and easiest way of arriving at anarchism on a large scale. Socialize every single thing, remove the requirement of wage slavery, and then opt out of the legal system and economy entirely.\n\nThe other method I see is instead of socializing things through the political system, instead focus on not needing them at all through decentralization. Albeit that method is a bit harder, as you need to find alternative solutions for everything, rather than just jumping on board with existing ones. It'd also be more difficult to get people to switch as it'd require lifestyle changes for them.",

That is actually doing what you choose, its a defiant act and it makes the work of banks and corporations and police difficult and tiresome. \n\nI still don't see how it helps in the long run. Technically speaking, most major businesses have enough saved to go decades without earning a profit.

The political/legal system, *large* amounts of people opting out of the economy, a lifestyle change to opt out of using services/goods *completely* (not just boycotting for a week), etc. Big changes need big actions, and smashing a window isn't going to lead up to anything greater.

In the greater scheme people will still hoard and you'll still end up with millionaires/billionaires, just not using the tokens but through other ownership like companies, jets, gold, etc. Duniter just guarantees that everyone has money, and that everyone is able to exchange that money for stuff.

I just don't see it.\n\nThat's the thing. The rich don't *have* to 'give up their wealth'. You can just make their 'wealth' useless. Wealth inequality only exists because the majority of people say it does. If the majority of people reject that, then it's not a thing. Imagine, instead of forcefully taking something, or breaking something, a wealthy person attempts to continue using their wealth. They can't drive their car because no one delivers the gas to fuel it. They can't fly where they need to go because no one flies them there. Perhaps these things are still done, but wealth is ignored entirely. Opt out and reject the systems at play. Even if the wealthy attempt to claim something, there'd be no one guaranteeing that ownership for them. Simply put, when everyone refuses to 'play', power suddenly disappears. The issue, then, is getting everyone on the same page and opting out.\n\n> [thisweb11](#comment_323_1D9w8AJTfqmn26iT2kF81B8HxXFfycXuXM): So the trick isnt to stop doing what these anarchist are doing.

Or mass campoaign to increase the wages of McDonalds workers (and buying moire burgers to support that)?   \n\nNeither. Mass boycotting of buying food indefinitely would be the proper answer. Boycotting McDonalds won't do anything. I *already* 'boycott' McDonalds. I just don't eat there. Hasn't done a damn thing. I encourage people to not eat there whenever possible. Not because I think it'll help anarchism, but simply because it's a shitty business. You need people to *opt-out*. If you're just moving your business from McDonalds to Burger King you haven't helped anything.\n\n> The hurting people in capitalist workplaces line is a really not going to wash with many anarchists.  Its been used by socialists and capitalists alike to justify everything from pimping women as prostitutes to implimenting UK laws making it illegal for supermarkets to boycott Israeli products.  People will always be hurt when attcking capitalism.  Lots of people have pensions invested in oil and arms companies, we are all micro capitalists and have vested interests in keeping the capitalists in power.  Unfortunatly thats no excuse to ignore it and oppress the rest of the world who doesn’t have anything invested in it but misery.  All the people who dont even have minimum wage jobs at mcdonalds who live in the rainforsets being chopped down to supply burgers for example.\n\nI think you've mistaken what I'm saying. Attacking a *particular location* isn't going to help and will just cause inconvenience to bystanders who may be more than happy to join the cause right up until you interfered with their daily lives by releasing cockroaches where they try to make a living so they don't starve. Instead you'd want to do something like attack the stock exchange if you want to hurt the business itself.\n\n> If every mcdonalds was infected with cochroaches in a mass revolt, they most certainly wouuld feel it.   Adn if they didnt we could do it again and again until they closed down.  The trick is in gettijg enough people to do it.  The tactic itself is actually the most effective one I can think of thats non violent.\n\nI don't see how that'd end up putting mcdonalds out of business. If anything they'd just push resources into security and laws to crackdown on it, and then get militarized police to stop it. They aren't going to go out of business that way. Look at the big banks. They were pretty much doomed to close down due to financial impact. You know what they did? Lobbied the government and got a ton of money to keep going, and the people who were simply involved at the more basic levels were the ones who got hurt.

All the opposition would have to do is wait until people get hungry or have medical needs at which point most people will start working again. Even if you, say, had all of those people willing to steal (most aren't, morally, and likely wouldn't due to the existing law and their mindset of following it) then you'd still run out of food after it was all consumed. At which point the same systems would start back up and nothing would change. Instead you need to be able to just opt-out.

The question first has to be why would they take it?   Without private property and the ability to sell it what would be the point?   Possesions are items that are of personal value, and can't be used to exploit people for labour etc, and have no special value to others in the community .  Eg a teddy bear.  And possessions can also be shared\n\nThis is where I really draw an issue with people who seem to have taken more political classes than actually thought through what would really happen and what would be best. Realistically speaking, *I as an individual* don't really give a shit about 'the means of production'. I don't care if I have access to a factory. I care if I have access to, say, a shelter with functional electricity/heating/internet, food that I can eat, water to drink, some sort of transportation to get around, etc. These are *also* the things that people are the most likely to 'steal'. People don't steal factories or restaurants. They steal food and electronics. The 'possessions' as you call them. In ancap or any other system with a monetary system, *these* are the things that would be restricted and people would lack the ability to access. Which means the exact same problems exist: lack of communication, lack of food/water, lack of clothing/shelter, etc.\n\nOr if you're thinking of things like tools, look at it this way.  You don't need to *own* a bike. You need access to one to be able to quickly get around. And you're not always using it, so after you're done someone else can use it. A teddy bear, quite frankly, is unneeded. Besides a few handcrafted personal sentimental items (*maybe*) I don't really see much need for them. Wasting resources on it is inefficient, and I'm willing to guess no one will willingly work to mass produce them when there's no real value there. The 'value' was that people have a consumeristic mindset and have been indoctrinated to hoard things. And thus they buy unneeded things like teddy bears or other pointless material things. When you get rid of the profit angle, there's no need to produce or own those things.\n\nThere's also no need to own a factory or anything like that. You just use it. As I said, how would bitcoin even work if no ownership was guaranteed? Things that are needed would be taken and used. Things that aren't would not be bought or sold.",

I do have the money to donate to any of these decentralized projects if they are 100% user friendly for non-coders. I still do not see any improvement to ZeroBlog and other sites on ZeroNet are still buggy. There's still no good youtube site where people can easily upload videos. App Centre http://127.0.0.1:43110/1LANDERvVWbShpNWpsrbBvfqSK1PabXtwv/ has no apps. ZeroPlus http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NCRELKZ3zWRS6DijziYrfWi9dsUY8Fh8n/ Avatars don't seem work. Even gifs don't work on 0ChanPorn http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NZNtZQZHQRJXafvJpmY5jgqwRaCEZMsUc The only thing that seems to work ok is the email and your music sites and that's not enough to get people to use ZeroNet. I knew this would be another failed project and so far I've been right. I think I'll just start donating money to the poor people. You guys have a nice day.\n\nDude you sound like such a troll right now. You know how long it took for those sites on clearnet to start working? Youtube took probably a few decades before the technology was there. This is *bleeding edge* stuff. It's not gonna be facebook. I've uploaded videos to KopyKate just fine. It's entirely straight forward if you follow the step by step video walkthrough. How much simpler do you need? How the fuck did you even get here on ZeroNet if you can't follow simple instructions?\n\nAs for 'App Center' and 'ZeroPlus' I have never seen nor used those sites. The first appears to be an unofficial attempt at making zeronet into an 'appstore', which it's not. And the latter is a chinese site that quickly cloned zerotalk. Of course neither of those are going to be high quality.\n\n0ChanPorn... do I even need to say? It's clearly a quick/crap clone of 0Chan, which even itself is still a very new attempt at getting the chans on here. Be glad it even exists.\n\n>Email\n\nWe don't have email on ZeroNet. You're thinking of the messaging site ZeroMail. Which is probably the only thing on here that *doesn't* consistently work for me. I always find it has issues with decrypting, sending, whatever. Very buggy. If you want the good sites, ZeroTalk is flawless, and ZeroMe is easily the best site on the network. I'm also very fond of Play and my own site Kaffiene. KopyKate, while the UI kinda sucks, works perfectly for video sharing. I've had 0 problems with it.\n\nAs for 'music sites'.... we don't have one of those. At least that's popular enough to be considered one. Just some really quick thrown together tech demos. Which is most of what ZeroNet is at the moment, *because it's brand new tech that's available NOWHERE else*. But do please show me where you find this stuff if ZeroNet is so awful? Where's *your* P2P youtube? Where's *your* DISTRIBUTED social network? AFAIK, ZeroMe is both the most active, and the only *proper* distributed social network.\n\nIt honestly sounds like you're crying because you came into a place where there's still development going on, and is highly focused towards developers, and then started crying because it's not Twitter/Facebook/Youtube. Seriously? Those sites have been around for a decade. ZeroNet has been around 2 years, with most sites less than 1. The sites are all made by hobbyist programmers, and it's all bleeding edge stuff. There's gonna be bugs, and you're gonna have to use your brain at the moment.\n\nIf you honestly have a more userfriendly P2P web platform, please share with us. AFAIK ZeroNet is it. It's the best and most userfriendly. *All* of our developers here strive to ensure that the sites are very welcoming and open. As well as feature amazing tech. If you've got something better, I'm sure everyone here is all ears. We're here because ZeroNet is the closest we've found to our idealized distributed web and we're all helping to build it. If you wanna help, then by all means stick around. But if you're just gonna insult progress and pretend there's something better, then I don't think anyone really cares for you to stick around.\n\nHonestly? You sound like an entitled millennial trust fund baby who can't do anything for himself. While the money would be great, I doubt many of us care for capitalism in general. Personally I'm here to make that money of yours *useless*. I like people who actually give a shit and can see a good thing when it's in front of them. Not someone who's gonna act entitled and bitchy and pretend bleeding edge tech is comparable to decades old websites. Did you also stumble onto the internet in the 80s and say \"well this is all shit, where's my video streaming? Look at this, sites barely even link to each other!\" No, of fucking course you didn't. You came onto the internet like every other self-entitled fuck in the 2000's when everything was baby-fied for you.\n\n> I knew this would be another failed project and so far I've been right.\n\nFailed project and yet we have one of the more active userbases for truly distributed networks. Again, feel free to share with the class if you have something better. Personally, I'll drop zeronet as soon as something better comes along. I have no attachment to the project other than wanting what's best for the internet.\n\nIf you want something, spit it out. Give explicit details of what you want. Because from where I'm standing, KopyKate is *more* usable than Youtube. ZeroMe is *more* useable than twitter or facebook. In general, these sites are *better* than their clearnet alternative. They put power back into the hands of the user, and give you complete control over your data. How is that a bad thing? But sure, go back to your walled gardens just because they have thousands of people working on them for decades with billions in funding. If you're just gonna act entitled, we don't want you here.",

But someone just not even trying and acting arrogant about it like it's all awful is just ugh. I'm still really curious about what P2P distributed platform he thinks is *good*. Because honestly? I've tried most if not all of them, and ZeroNet is the best. If I had money, I'd donate. It's the one tech project out of the hundreds/thousands I've seen that I actually think is going somewhere. It's the new web and I 110% believe and support that.\n\n>I only coded the avatars in a day (which works perfectly for me ;) as proof that these are not major issues. \n\nAvatars on finished sites (ZeroMe) work fine. It's when you come across a buggy half-coded site and then complain zeronet is shit is when you've got a problem. I mean, you have to really expect it. I wasn't surprised at all to find half-missing documentation, lots of half-assed attempts at sites, but an overall enthusiastic, but small, crowd in support of this project. It's pretty much exactly what I expected when I signed up.\n\n> Paying rent is a major issue\n\nIdeally, once I'm done with things, paying rent won't be an issue for anyone. Shouldn't exist. But tbh that's probably the main thing holding people back. People can't work on free/future tech because we're stuck figuring out how to pay the bills.\n\n>Oh, but people want us to make a PERFECT decentalized internet first.. then they might \"cough up\" some money. Like.. yeah sure. How exactly does one sit, code, and not pay rent? Hmm.\n\nYup haha. Gotta have an exact copy of the current web, but decentralized. And then *maybe* he'll give you a dollar or two.

I already quit promoting ZeroNet months ago because I finally decided I will only promote things I can use myself. I can't use ZeroBlog so there's really no reason for me to promote ZeroNet.\n\nHopefully the non-coding aspect is still somewhat appealing. Personally I didn't do much coding for my own blog and it works fine (though I *did* customize it a bit). It's kinda hard to keep non-tech people when everything is still heavily WIP. I've been trying to get my non-tech boyfriend into zeronet and he's just been confused from step 1 haha. Personally I usually don't promote ZeroNet to people unless I have a reason. And so far those reasons have been for development, and for political reasons. I'd hate to say that tech-illiterate people should just leave, but a lot of this stuff honestly isn't as friendly as popular sites are. ZeroNet *does* take a bit more effort, as does every P2P software. It's a different way of doing things and sometimes you gotta be open to trying something new.\n\nHopefully ZeroTalk/ZeroMe/KopyKate, and other well polished sites are enough to keep you around. We definitely need more users, techy or not. The development side has honestly been kinda lacking, so I can see why people wouldn't find it that appealing. I see ZeroNet currently as a long-term thing, not as a 'replace the internet this second!' thing. Stick around, see what happens. You know?",

				"body": ">how does zeronet handle multiple ID's?\n\nZN logs your public/private keys, and associates them with a particular ID service and name. Your keys file also stores a signed message from the ID service to demonstrate it's properly signed. KaffieID simply has the server's private key available publicly, so that no backend is needed. This means that names are not guaranteed to be unique. From there, zites can accept IDs from certain provider sites, and with that you can have a chain of trust. You can trust ZeroID to have unique names, and as such if you see someone with a particular zeroid, you can know for sure it's them. With KaffieID this is not possible, since the whole point is to make it so names are not unique and freely changeable with no server backend.\n\nOn the backend, how your user files (comments, uploads, etc) are stored is based on this public/private key pair, rather than your ID name. This is why KaffieID still works. This is guaranteed to be unique for every single ID generated. The same user cannot freely generate new key pairs for a site easily; though you can by removing the keys and restarting zeronet. This feature is what lets KaffieID freely associate different names to the same keypair.\n\nThe keypair is associated from your ZN daemon to the particular site. That is, your keypair for KaffieID is different than your keypair for ZeroID. With that, you can switch between wholly unique accounts on the same machine, simply by selecting your different provider. You can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/UJFg65M.png) that I have quite a few different accounts I can access without restarting my ZN.\n\n> I want to know exactly how much shit will break if I have let's say 3 ID's for different purposes on the same pc.\n\nNothing will break. ZN was built with this in mind. However, having 3 ZeroIDs would be kind of a pain to set up, but you can do it.\n\n>since practically all zites that needs a form of authentication seems to have a select user button I assume it should be possible?\n\nIndeed. Though by default zites have a whitelist of valid ID providers. This is almost exclusively ZeroID, but a few accept ZeroVerse or KaffieID too.\n\n>But zeroid won't let you have multiple zeroid id's.\n\nIt will, but it won't let you generate a new one if you're already logged in. Basically, since your keypair for the site is associated with your zeroid, whenever you visit the site it'll detect your keypair for the site is already paired with a zeroid and not let you generate a new one. To get around this, you'd need to delete the ZeroID entry in your sites file, then remove the zeroid from your list of accounts, restart zeronet (making sure the stuff is deleted), generate a new zeroid, then restore your old zeroid account in your account list, and restart zeronet again. You should then have 2 zeroids in your list and can freely select between them, much like you see in mine how there's my @kaffie.bit and @kaffie.bit - hack. It's not *supposed* to be used this way, and most people find it easier to just set zeronet in multi-user mode and go from there. But it's possible to do.\n\n>So if I then use kaffieID or some other random ID service can I just roll around with 5 different ID's without zeronet either shitting itself or zites stopping to work altogether?\n\nYou must do the same process on KaffieID as well, even though it lets you freely change your name. As your account is actually the keypair, and the name is just a descriptive label for it. As you see in my list, I have two KaffieID accounts, and they both work fine on services that accept KaffieID. And since KaffieID doesn't care about name uniqueness, you can even have the same name for multiple accounts if you wish. Though some sites may rely on name uniqueness, and ZeroMe had this problem at first when I was testing all this. I happened to have user info of my other account fed to me improperly due to the name. However, as long as the site goes by public key for determining the user (as it should, since that's how the file storage is determined), then all should be well.",

Switching the backend to a merger site format would work better too, as trying to shift it when there is content would be an issue.",

Would be cool if that could be integrated in a way to get warned before you see it. Even better to get warned before downloading, but that might be more difficult. Yes I know, every filter can be abused for censoring political stuff. But if it is just a warning, you can still decide yourself if you have doubts.\n\nI recall one user started a blocklist called 'pedoblocker' or somethng. I'm not sure entirely how it worked But I think it was an after-the-fact measure. Where it deletes and then makes the space unwritable for certain folder locations within zeronet. Effectively blocking certain sites. I think that an adblock type solution built into zeronet where you can 'subscribe' to different lists would be good. If you want to see everything, just don't block anything. If you have an issue with a certain type of content, then subscribe to a particular blocklist for that content.

There is no backend server for zeronet. Meaning people must host content themselves. This is equally as true of fastcast. fastcast simply has a dedicated seedbox hosting the videos. There is a tutorial on kopykate on how to set up dropbox as a seedbox.

Just like fastcast does.\n\nAs for *other* videos not being up, yes. Because people who upload things don't pay attention and fail to seed them. If you're looking for something like youtube, with a dedicated host, you're likely not going to find it for now.

I mentioned a few earlier.\n\n> There are scientific theories opposing anything in the science community. \n\nThis is the bullshit I'm talking about. Do you even know what a scientific theory *is*? No. There isn't.\n\n>There are both popular and unpopular opinions in the science world, but popularity alone is not proof in the scientific world.\n\nHas nothing to do with popularity. Popularity is irrelevant to actual science.\n\n>If that were the case, we'd still believe the old popular theory of a flat world.\n\nMany people still do. They're all right-wing conservatives. Just yet another example of my point.\n\n>Also, what do you mean you can't debate about abortion?\n\nThe only debate that can really be had is \"abortion shouldn't happen\" vs \"we need it though or people die.\" These are not conflicting positions. What the 'abortion shouldn't happen' people are arguing is that the alternative is just everything is okay. Not that people die. That's not reality. But the other side \"we need anyone to have the choice for an abortion whenever\" also really isn't right. It's needed, in terms of medical, environment, and economic reasons. But it's not needed as a free choice, as there's many options for birth control. On the flip side, the anti-abortion people are *also* often against birth control, which are conflicting positions (you can't ban abortion and then also ban birth control).\n\nIn reality the answer should just be: make the decision most medically necessary, allowing for some patient choice in the manner like all healthcare. Which is arguably the liberal position.\n\n>Are your ideas on abortion so dead-set that even if new evidence were to surface would you not take a look at your stance again?\n\nThe only thing that'd change my stance on abortion would be the widespread and free use of artificial incubators in every case where abortion would occur. Because that would be the better alternative.\n\n>I'd be interesting in reading one of these studies; maybe I'm wrong.\n\n[1](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611421206) [2](http://2012election.procon.org/sourcefiles/Kanai_Political_Orientations.pdf) [3](http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/Amodio%20Jost%20Neurocognitive%20correlates%20of%20liberalism%20and%20conservatism.pdf) [4](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0190272510361602) [5](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289614000373) (5 shows that it's the social beliefs, not the economic ones that demonstrate intelligence even among republicans).\n\nThat enough? And all of those have extra studies referenced in them. It's pretty clear that religion and conservative social views are correlated with less education and less intelligence. In terms of economic views, it tends to be unrelated to intelligence (which makes sense as there's solid and intelligent arguments on both sides).\n\nI could give studies that show why economic conservatism is also bad, but in reality *I* used to be economically conservative (the typical socially liberal, economically conservative). There's good arguments for it and many smart people support those views. But they're still bad long-term for a variety of reasons. I'd wager there's still an intelligence/education thing going on there, but less so than the social views.",

Quite the question as to how initial posting works; perhaps a filter searches for the auth_key first, and if found doesn't trigger creation function, while said creation function does not recognize anything other than the certSelect API call's array of accepted cert issuers. Something to poke later.\n\nYeah I just ran into this same bug. After doing some digging it appears to me that it's due to the modified name being listed as the cert signer. There's a field in the user's content.json which looks like this: `\"cert_user_id\": \"kaffie@zeroid.bit\",`. When the first description field is modified as in your example, when creating a new content.json it writes it as \"kaffie@modifiedname\". This then leads to a problem as zeronet checks the site's content.json for this:\n\n```\n  \"cert_signers\": {\n   \"kaffie.bit\": [\n    \"1KH5BdNnqxh2KRWMMT8wUXzUgz4vVQ4S8p\"\n   ],\n   \"zeroid.bit\": [\n    \"1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz\"\n   ]\n  },\n```\n\nWhich links the @whatever.bit to an actual address. This, of course, is yet *another* reason why names should *not* be used for unique identifiers. @nofish: needs to really fix these bugs and rely *only* on unique public keys instead of various domain names/user names/etc. The actual cert itself contains *no* information as to which site actually signed it. That's a huge problem. Ideally the cert should contain the address of the signing site, which is included in the content.json for the user. Then this sign+site address should be used to verify that it's legitimate and in the valid list of site signers. \n\nLots of problems unfortunately.",

No good. Their views typically correlate with similar stuff as well, which honestly isn't surprising. That's not to say people who are pro-choice *want* abortions or like them, but that they should be determined by the doctor and patient, not by the law.\n\nAnd now to tear apart your idiocy.\n\n>People who have sexual identities problems like you think that this is such an important thing. \n\nI don't have sexual identity problems.

And I decided to call you out on it. It's not like I'm randomly bringing up this shit every time I have a conversation. But morons like you are obsessed for some reason with \"finding out ivanka is really a man!111!\" like some sort of horrible idiotic tabloid gone wrong. Who gives a fuck?

AFAIK, most other countries are more open than sex than they are about violence. America is the prudes haha. Does it matter though? Lady Gaga is cool.\n\n>all of this shit create disturbance in the identities of the people,\n\nLol holy shit. Do you really think those are the reasons trans people exist? hahahahaha. That's so fucking dumb. No. The reason trans people exist is due to a birth defect related to the hormones produced while in the womb. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Anime doesn't make you trans, sorry. And neither does anything else. It's just a birth defect like every other sex disorder.\n\n>and then some guys like you who haven't clearly identified the source of this say: gender are not defined by birth. \n\nDid I say that? I don't think I did. I know exactly the source. It seems you're the one who does not.\n\n>Of course it is defined by birth.\n\nIndeed.

Think about it for a second. If those things were actually the cause, why would only a minority of people be trans? Certainly it should be an epidemic! \n\n>Since you are not stupid and can probably think in good faith,\n\nIndeed. I've already gone through this and many arguments like it and debunked them all. Which is why I find it hilarious and a bit upsetting when people like you come out and act like you know everything, and in reality just spread hate and don't know a damn thing.\n\n>did the primitive tribes have gender identities troubles?\n\nThe answer to that is unsusprisingly YES. Gender identity disorder, and being trans, are not new things. They've been around basically forever. Such people are included in more or less every culture in the world, most holy books, and indeed at least as far back as our current knowledge of history goes. At least, true transsexuality. I don't speak for the modern trends and shit, whatever those might be.\n\n>Does the last primitive tribes living on earth have gender identities problems? Of course not.\n\nThey actually do. In the same sense as everyone else. Because it's a biological issue, not a cultural one. The only real difference is that we just recently got the ability to do something about it.\n\n>Thus gender identities troubles are not genetic\n\nYou're right. They aren't genetic.\n\n>but only a consequence of this particulary crazy society. \n\nNope. Has nothing to do with society. Sorry but you're objectively demonstrably wrong here. Or by \"this particularly crazy society\" do you mean *all* of human society throughout history?\n\n>Listen to me, i reject all this progressive shit.\n\nYou reject actual medical science, yes. It appears you also reject actual environmental science, along with biology.\n\n>Not because i'm a bad nazi or intolerant bastard, but because all of it is a consequence of capitalism in it's final development. \n\nNo. Your idiocy is *not* a result of capitalism. It's your own damn fault you're retarded. The internet is available. You can read the research yourself.\n\n>There is not LGBT in a primitive tribes.\n\nThere is though. And the LGB part has even been observed in animals.\n\n>All these guys are lost souls who cannot even correctly point the source of their unhapiness.\n\nAlright. Tell me.

Ideally, I think it'd be good to have something as user-friendly as GitHub, but backed by zeronet, using optional files to house tarred/compressed headless git repos. [...]\n\nThe big question is the technical side of things. You have to make sure that git will actually push to such a site. I don't really know what goes on behind the scenes,but if you want to make some sort of ZeroGitHub, then looking at current ways of putting git repos on ZeroNet would be the first step I'd think.\n\nOne way could be to make a site like 0git, but as a merger site (kinda like zerome) and then have git repos act as 'hubs' that you can download and look through. Optional files are another way to go, but I personally don't like the centralization there. Every git repo managed by a super-admin of the site? Why not just benefit from ZeroNet's decentralization?\n\nUse something like what I linked as the hosting method, and then build some sort of github frontend that makes viewing them easy.",

How can I see them?\n\nRegistered ZeroIDs can be found in the zeroid.bit data.json files. So in your ZN data folder, just go to `1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz/data/` and you'll see users.json (newly registered users) and users_archive.json (older users). users.json has about 800 people last I checked, and users_archive.json has like 42,000 or something like that. So together that makes about 43,000 zeroid users.\n\nThe other number, for ZeroMe users is a bit more difficult. Theoretically the ZeroMe user registry (1UDbADib99KE9d3qZ87NqJF2QLTHmMkoV) would have every user who signed up for it. But that's not quite right. As it cuts out other IDs other than zeroid and zeroverse (kaffieIDs don't show up in there). And given that's a mess, I figured using the merged database would be better and is found at `1MeFqFfFFGQfa1J3gJyYYUvb5Lksczq7nH/merged-ZeroMe/ZeroMe.db`. Now if looking through an sql db doesn't sound like fun, no worries! I did the hard stuff for you already. You can find the python script I use to read the DB and scrape a list of users along with intro/auth_addr/etc. [here.](/kaffiene.bit/zeromeusers.py) And if *that* is still too much work, you can just [use kaffiene to search through the users.](/kaffiene.bit/?q=&i=ZeroMe%20Users) As you can see, Kaffiene's current index pulls up 8503 users from the DB. And the index can be found [here.](/kaffiene.bit/userdata.txt)\n\nPretty simple tbh. My ZeroMe count might be off though if I messed something up in my code. But AFAIK that should be the entire list (minus people who just signed up after I published).",

I guarantee it. Somalia does not follow it. It might be 'anarchy' in the colloquial usage, but it's not the political ideology of anarchism.

Can I produce hate speech against nazis? How about Muslims? Christians? Black people? White People? Is hate speech different than simply inciting violence against a group? Does the group need to be oppressed for it to count as hate speech?\n\nHate speech is wishing ill intent on a person due to unchoosable characteristics. At least, that's how I see it. Hating someone for being a nazi or muslim or christian is bad. Hating nazism, islam, and christianity is perfectly fine. Hating black people is bad. Hating blackness is still bad. If you're attacking the person, it's hate speech. If you're attacking something the person did not choose, it's hate speech.\n\nThere has been hate speech against white people. See the SJWs/liberals and BLM. For more recent events, introducing a religion ban is *not* hate speech. Wishing to abolish and eliminate islam is *not* hate speech. Hating or harming someone who *is* muslim, *is* hate speech.\n\nHate speech incites violence by it's nature.

You can request other sites data, or users data ?\n\nMerger sites work by classifying a group of similar sites as 'hubs' or w/e name you want to give them. They have their own little section on ZeroHello, and each 'type' of hub is in it's own category. From there, whatever site can classify itself as a 'merger site' for a particular hub type. The merger site then gets access to all of the data hosted on the various hubs a user has downloaded of that type.\n\nSo anything that classifies itself as a 'ZeroMe merger site' will request access (and get it) for the ZeroMe hub sites. This lets you have multiple different merger sites that work similarly access the same data. And thus be able to modify the UI, or do whatever special functions on it you want. On the data side, anyone can start up their own hub of any type. So you can easily clone a ZeroMe hub and have it automatically listed among the rest of the ZeroMe-type hubs. No modification needed to any of the merger sites that access the collection.\n\nThis is really good for anything where users will store their data, since they aren't locked into a frontend merger site. If, for instance, nofish really messes up ZeroMe, you can just use one of the ZeroMe clones and not have to deal with those new changes. Likewise, you can use a hub that you trust, instead of relying on nofish (or any other merger site owner) to manage your data.\n\nZeroMe uses the 'optional files on hubs' system to host pictures. And, IMO, it works really well. Images have never been down for me, and they're perfectly decentralized and entirely optional to host.\n\nOne could easily take advantage of ZeroMe's image feature to create a filehost that hosts files unconnected with ZeroMe posts, but are still hosted by anyone who decides to \"host all files\" for a particular hub.",

It works just fine without cryptocurrency.Similar to BOINC, it works just fine without a cryptocurrency, but for those people that are interested, they can be rewarded Gridcoin for contributing to BOINC.So for instance vanilla ZeroNet could be sans cryptocurrency, but could have a version that has support for it also.  [...]\n\nIf you own 51% of the mining power of a blockchain, you can control what happens. It's a huge problem for bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies that have become centralized as difficulty rose. For smaller currencies it becomes an easy target, depending on the number of nodes.\n\nSo let's say we have ZeroNet coin. *Everyone* running a ZeroNet node then helps manage the blockchain and is a full blockchain mining node. Given ZeroNet has.... what? 5000 users tops? That means that an attacker only needs 2501 of those nodes in order to completely manipulate it.\n\nWhile this may seem extreme (it's easier when you have a mining pool that makes up 44% of users ;P ), keep in mind this is the scenario OP presented: someone having significant enough control over the network/nodes that they can manipulate traffic. Personally, I think the 51% attack would cause more damage and overall reduce security of ZeroNet.\n\nPersonally, I think if ZeroNet was going to add a cryptocurrency, why not just include a basic bitcoin wallet, or namecoin wallet? All the core dev-work is there, it's massively popular and watched like a hawk, and it'd fit right in with zeronet addresses/users by default. With a ZN-specific coin, nofish's time and effort would be even more divided than it already is.",

Have a request feature in the API. You enter the site you wish to fetch a file from, and then the inner_dir of the file.

Very unlikely, but still a possibility. However, with the ZeroMe key they do not have *direct* access to a user's post.\n\n>In fact, there is no point in hacking ZeroMe or one hub. ZeroMe can be taken down only if each hub is destroyed, because data is stored in multipal hubs.\n\nIf you wanted to take down ZeroMe the best route would be to either make a phishing site, which is a clone of ZeroMe but automatically deletes all your data. Or it'd be to get ZeroMe's private key, and then edit the site to auto-delete every post when a user comes on.\n\n>Another way is destroying ZeroMe user registry. It has links to users' avatars, links to their hubs, usernames and users' descriptions. But most of this data can be restored from hubs.\n\nAttacking the user registry will not harm ZeroMe's functionality. The only thing that'd be impaired is the 'all users' list.\n\n>Descriptions cannot be restored too, but who thinks about it when you have saved ZeroNet?\n\nProfile info is stored on the user's selected hub.

There are plenty of variants of 'socialism' that *don't* require forcing you to do things (socialistic/communistic anarchism, for example). As for \"forcing you to commit some of your properties to the country/gov\", *capitalism* does this. Namely through the form of taxation, printing new currency (decreasing the value of your own), civil forfeiture, etc. And they *force* you to commit your time and work to uphold the existing system (don't like capitalism? time to throw you in a box or possibly kill you!) It's not much different than the authoritarian systems in say North Korea or China. People may *label* those as 'socialism' or 'communism' and then *claim* that the US is different. But fundamentally it's the same political structure. One has just progressed further politically (namely the more restrictive ones) and are more restrictive. But make no mistake, these are still capitalistic countries.\n\nA true socialistic system/country/whatever would be something more like ZeroNet or a mesh network. Everyone pitches in and helps, but there isn't any authoritative or coercive control over it. The *community* owns things, rather than a single individual being able to manipulate everything. This difference isn't capitalism (being 'better') vs socialism (being 'worse'). It's anarchism/libertarianism vs authoritarianism/facism.\n\nA free capitalistic web will look like what we see on the clearnet. Lots of companies censoring their sites, restricting access to data, putting up paywalls, etc. ISPs will censor sites freely, ignore net neutrality, etc. These are *capitalism's* ideas. It's 'free' in the sense that the *companies* can do whatever they like. Not the people. However, the criticisms of China and N. Korea are absolutely right. Those are extreme capitalistic/authoritarian systems. The exact *opposite* of what I personally advocate. Their capitalism restricts, their authoritarian government restricts. People aren't free nor equal.\n\nYou *can* have an authoritarian socialism. If you think of the political compass, it'd be at the 'top left'. With socialistic anarchism (what most of us here support) being in the 'bottom left'. Free unregulated capitalism would be in the bottom right, and what china/north korea have (authoritarian capitalism) would be in the top right.\n\nTo say you support capitalism, but then come to ZeroNet because you don't like the clearnet is *ridiculously* silly. ZeroNet goes against capitalism completely. There's *no* easy way to monetize content here.\n\n>I think he meant to say that you have more freedom of speech on sites like twitter -- while those are being maintained by commercial companies, there are way more FOS than in mainland China.\n\nThose sites do not focus on 'freedom of speech'. They are subject to the laws and rules on speech relating to the country they're hosted in. Facebook and Youtube in particular experience *heavy* censorship. Twitter is also known for lots of censorship on topics they don't like. They're 'free' in the sense that they allow you to converse without too much hassle. However, there's still tons of problems, and don't think for a second they'll stay that way if/when the US starts cracking down on the freedom of speech. The only thing protecting us on those sites is that it's legal to say those things in the US. Do note it *is* possible to use those sites in china. You don't *have* to use ZeroNet. So if they're so great? Why not just go use those? Personally, those are the type of sites *I'm* escaping from. They are much too restrictive.\n\n>Sometimes there's a thin barrier between languages and it's easy to get a few words wrong, so let's try to understand what each other is actually saying :-)\n\nNo worries. I was just poking a bit of fun. I might've been a little irritated at the time lol. Most people here (that I've talked to) *support* socialistic/communistic anarchism. So it's a bit silly to say the people actually on here are somehow 'inferior' while you support what we do. In my eyes, China is the end result of capitalism. When you let companies run free, and increase government control. I can't see where that is socialism or communism? Do they get free medical? Free housing/food/basic income? Are they able to opt-out of coercive capitalistic employment? Something tells me the answer is *no*.",

				"body": "My favorite thing about ZeroNet (that can't be done on clearnet) is super easy site cloning and hosting. It's two clicks max for both. Want to upload some content? New site -> paste your files -> sign -> publish -> share. That simple. On the clearnet? Well first you need to go pay for hosting (because who self-hosts? If you do, you need to call up your ISP for a static IP or find another solution), then you need to go buy a domain name, both of which you need to pay yearly for. Set up the nameservers properly so they point your domain to your host. Wait however many hours that all takes. Then ftp or ssh into your server and upload your files. It's a huge pain and expensive.\n\nThere's the censorship issue. But also identity. Since all sites have signed verification by default, you can be certain that content signed by a particular public key is trustworthy. Rather than wondering if it's the same user or if the site was hacked or if there was a MITM attack.\n\nThere's the whole offline and mesh benefits. ZN doesn't need centralized domain names, and hopefully soon won't need to rely on centralized IP allocation either (as soon as ipv6 and dht support get here so it can go on cjdns). Lose internet? still access sites, yay.\n\nAlways open source. Any site you see has the source fully available. The only time this is not true is when you leave ZeroNet (by requesting resources on clearnet/ipfs/whatever).\n\nWith Merger sites you've got a separated front-end/back-end setup, and back-end being decentralized and user-driven. This means that sites can rapidly improve through it's open source nature, data isn't held hostage (it's always the user's!) and front-end services can be swapped out easily. This means there's no drama or huge 'site takeover' issues. Reddit's mod team piss you off? Just use a different data hub. The front-end site sucks now? Throw up a mirror of the old code and use it with the same backend.\n\nAs mentioned earlier: users have control over their data! They have *full* (not partial or obscured) control over any data they post on ZeroNet. With merger sites it's possible to host your own hub, and therefore have *full* and uncensored control over your data.\n\nCentralized universal ID certificates! Lots of groups tried to push this on the clearnet but it always failed by design. However, with ZeroNet you can use the same ID practically anywhere. And with services like KaffieID, you can register your account completely offline and make no outside requests (completely private!). Albeit, no 'all signers' option for sites, so there's still problems there.\n\nSites are always up. This is great. No worries about DDOSing or hosting issues or government takedowns. You put something up, it will always be up, guaranteed.\n\nThat's just a few things off the top of my head. For the *user* there's not much benefit. The actual content and sites as of now are honestly worse and less active than clearnet alternatives. It's more an ideological thing, and hopefully better infrastructure.",

It's only 25€ or so, one time, and for domain, I first used a free Dyn-DNS-provider (No-IP), and now I somewhat switched (still re-activating the No-IP-domain :D) to a domain I bought, which costs only 0.75cents a month (or so,.. I forgot xD).\n\nSo lots of paid services, buying hardware, having to have an always-on server (even if it's a raspberry pi), and still running it off your home network and thus prone to all sorts of issues. Setup is also complicated and not intuitive.\n\n>Yes, I admit, it all was somewhat hard'ish to set up, but I mean, why not!? :D\n\nBecause the point is to make it *easy*. Let *anyone* be able to quickly put up a website with one or two clicks. I could probably teach my mom how to make a ZeroNet blog. But all that? No hope. Stuck in tech support hell lol. Obviously there *are* cheap ways of doing self-hosting (albeit not free). However, the ZeroNet solution is easier and cheaper.\n\n>About the thing that the user has full control of posting stuff, maybe,.. because I could just go into ThunderWave's code, and edit it, so that User 1 only sees messages from a selected range\n\nWell yes. Site owners have full control over their site. But if your run your own site or hub (like I do with KaffieHub) then that's not an issue. It's a caveat, but a minor one. What ZN offers is *leagues* ahead of, say, something like Facebook or Reddit.\n\n>Not everybody can code, not everybody wants to code, not everybody is concerned about his data's security (hmm, the last is somewhat not the case for probably any user on the ZeroNet :D), so if User 1 is just a \"normal\" End-User, why should he check the code?!\n\nThat's another good point. ZeroNet is *way* easier for people who don't want to code. Lots of things are 0 hassle.\n\n>Zites are not always up. If all users just delete it, or have no internet access, then the user wanting to access the zite won't be able to download it (xD that's kind of a stupid argument right there, but everything can happen (though, this is true for somewhat private website e.g. a blog)).\n\nThis is the theory, but in practice this doesn't happen. Take a look at something like the [Toki Pona blog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/tokipona.bit/) or [this little snake game.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1JsJ1JitaLboc8pvo4fxh9dvP8mt6toPrE/) The blog was last updated nov 2016 and still has 61 peers my laptop can see. And the snake game has 159 and was last updated feb 2016. These aren't exactly popular sites either. Even the least popular and dead sites (that are near empty) still have a like 5-10 peers. It's *very* rare that a site that was used at some point will go down. In fact, I've only ever seen it happen once with ZeroTV, which was destroyed through the will of the owner. And yet now we have a 90% mirror that will likely remain up forever.\n\nThere *are* flaws with ZeroNet, but it's a hell of a lot better than the traditional hosting model. Especially for amateur and hobbyist programmers, or people who want 0-configuration hosting. I'm pretty sure it's easier to set up a blog here than it is to use wordpress, tumblr, or medium.",

Instead the site should automatically convert when it detects that you're using the pure domain name. Kaffiene does this. I think it's a more elegant solution than auto-converting links that are the typical format. As users might change that to compensate for others, but then it'll break for people who do things that don't support relative links.\n\nThis linking mess is honestly causing a lot of problems and there doesn't seem to be a clean solution. I wonder what nofish thinks about all this. Basically:\n\nproxies - Needs relative links or links using that particular proxy.\n\npure domain - needs absolute links in the format that matches their config (unknowable), pure domains, or *possibly* (depending on setup) http://zero/whatever format.\n\nstandard zn - needs relative links or links that use the default port.\n\nmodified zn - needs relative links or links that use the modified port.\n\n---\n\nPersonally I think it's best to abandon the pure http://whatever.bit/ format. There's no way to specify it's zeronet. Instead people should use zero://lettersnumbers or zero://domain.bit as a way of signifying general links. It's possible to configure one's browser to use zero:// links, and in the future, it'll be easy to link software/browsers/sites/whatever. You'd know it's exactly a zeronet url too. Alternatively, using the standard http://zero/whatever works as well. This would get around the proxy problem, the weird need for relative links, and the mess with port numbers. However, it's not supported by default and thus may not work for many people.\n\nSo what's the solution? The solution is to use relative links that auto-adjust for pure domain and proxy users. That tends to work best so far. It's clear to the users, clear to the viewers, etc.",

I support the right to free discussion, not free speech. People should certainly feel free to say what they want, but that doesn't mean anyone has to tolerate it or give them a platform. And the internet, regardless of what anyone might think, is a collection of computers that host people and what they say. If I have problems with what you say, I have every right to delete your words off my machine. That's not against free speech. You're still free to say it. You're just not free to put your words on my computer.\n\nLikewise, I support free discussion. I'm very open to hosting conversations and discussions that people wish to have, provided they're engaged in fairly and without hate.\n\nPut quite simply, the internet as we know it follows neither. It's a platform owned by various companies, and they do not support free discussion, nor just uncensored speech in any manner. ISPs and other internet providers are not different. And thus, we should focus on solutions where people are free to censor or engage with whatever content they want.",

Likewise, there's no server-side code, making it hard to do transactions and purchases.\n\n>Ethereum Prediction Market (something like www.betmoose.com)\n\n>Decentralized dice game (something like https://www.vdice.io)\n\nIIRC people have attempted these ones before. But honestly, they're pretty unrelated. And it really sounds like you're just taking ethereum apps and wanting them on zeronet. Why not just go back to ethereum if that's the platform you enjoy? It's clear you don't care about the goals or direction that ZeroNet is headed and instead just want it to be a copy+paste of ethereum.

And something that autologs sites will never exist. I tackled these issues with developing [Kaffiene](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffiene.bit). Search engines can always be messed with, given they're just sites. You might want to check out Yacy for clearnet though. In the future I hope to make Kaffiene use the merger feature, so that people may use their own site indexes, that'd avoid the centralization of indexing.\n\n>Run over mesh network (in the near future)\n\nLots of people want this. AFAIK it needs IPV6 and DHT support before this can happen. But after those two things are done, it can be put onto cjdns, and thus meshnets. Soon, maybe?\n\n>Supports larger zites and media (think LBRY)\n\nFirst, lbry is shit. I wouldn't want ZeroNet to become anything like that. Second, this is already happening. Large file support *is* coming. There *are* media sites already, such as [KopyKate](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kopykate.bit). But there's not really a clean way of handling it yet. The big issue I see is that not everyone has a lot of storage space to throw around. This is the big reason blockchains don't attract people.\n\n>Easier to make/clone zites and/or zite\n\nWat. How much easier does it need to be? You can literally click a single button and have a site. To write a custom site you literally just upload the html/js/css. Very stupid simple and anyone can do it.\n\n>Decentralized VPN support for privacy\n\nThis will never happen. Use a 3rd party solution if you want privacy.

You're aware of all the anarchists (and communists) marching around the US right now under the banner of Antifa who are literally holding up signs that say things like, \"Free Speech = Hate Speech\", right? Or burning giant signs that say, \"Freedom of Speech?\"\n\nI'm well aware. I, too, thought this was particularly strange. It's a core anarchist belief to reject hierarchy, which would mean you *can't* restrict speech. So I asked my fellow anarchists why there was this apparent disgust towards 'free speech'. They told me the reasons were two fold (and now I agree). The first is that 'free speech' is used as a dogwhistle for right-wing hate groups. It's not truly free discussion the advocates want, it's to be able to hate on people without social consequence. And indeed you see this in their spaces. Try to have a calm rational discussion, and the 'free speech' advocates ban and silence you. They don't want 'free speech' they want 'freedom to hate'. The second reason is that 'free speech' as it's used in the US today, doesn't actually refer to the ability to freely say what you want, nor say it without consequence. Instead, 'free speech' is used to refer to the 1st amendment of the government *restricting* speech, and controlling what you can or cannot say.\n\nIf you actually asked, most would actually be okay with calmly discussing things. Though, nazi views and fascism get a special exception. These ideologies in particular attempt to use discussion not as a serious inquiry into furthering each others' views, but rather as a platform in order to gain more followers. This is why a core concept is 'don't give them a platform'. It's not that anarchists want to *silence* people or make it illegal to say things. But rather, that the person should keep it to themselves, or among their circle, rather than spread it.\n\nLastly, anarchists do not believe you can actually restrict speech. Free speech isn't a right, it's just a natural thing people do. There's only what other people do in response to that speech. I personally agree with these views, which is why I've switch from supporting 'free speech' to supporting 'free discussion'.\n\n>They also wear spiffy t-shirts that advocate literally punching Nazis. Just the other day I saw a picture of a cake that was decorated in the style of the Red and Black anarcho-syndicalist/anarchist flag which said, \"Kill Nazis.\" \n\nThe people who do this on social  media are not anarchists (they're authoritarian communists). Some might be part of antifa, but legitimate serious anarchists *usually* don't do this unless it's a joke. If you ever see a nazi *actually* punched, there's almost always a bigger picture that's being ignored. *Or* the person who did it was then pulled back by antifa and anarchists. In fact, in many scenarios they explicitly attempt to keep peace. If you could point out specific examples, I can clarify the intent further.\n\n>Or maybe you meant the \"anarchists\" that still like capitalism, which many Marxist anarchists would also identify as Nazis... Read some of Antifa's pamphlets and fliers. \n\nAnyone who supports capitalism is not an anarchist. The two are mutually exclusive. As for the pamphlets and fliers, I see and read them. I actually follow various news organizations tied with antifa.\n\n>I still think the non-aggression principle holds value, \n\nI'm a fan of it, provided you remove the bits about property. I think it's very valid that people should not harm one another. And if they do, then it's okay to defend one's self or help defend one another.\n\n>Europeans can establish and maintain libertarian societies; we already have in the past and it worked out great. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with libertarianism or anarcho-capitalism. Both are wonderful ideologies I used to support myself. The problem, as I see it, is that they rely on capitalism to function. And capitalism, unfortunately, has many long-term problems. But in the short term it's wonderful.\n\n>I must say though, if you're really a libertarian, which I get the impression that you are, then why are you so strongly against discrimination in the laws? \n\nI'm not a libertarian. I used to be. I'm an anarchist like any other. I'm against laws themselves. But if we are to have them, they should apply to everyone equally. I uphold equality and freedom as two very important traits. As I'd be hypocritical to say I should be free while others must suffer. In my opinion, if you cannot accept the worst outcome of your political views, you should not have that as your political views. If you say 'X should be exterminated', then put yourself as X. If you say 'Being X should be illegal', put yourself as someone who is X. Would you still hold these views? A good example is to look at history. Women or blacks could not vote. Put yourself in place of women or blacks, or perhaps a black woman. Would you support this model of society? Of course not. Why would you restrict your own actions? As such, you've taken a hypocritical view. The only way to avoid this is to treat everyone equally and to provide as much freedom to as many people as possible. The only system that accomplishes this is anarchism.\n\n>BLM is roaming the streets shouting obscenities at people who are minding their own business, making credible threats of violence, rioting, looting, etc. \n\nI agree. BLM has many problems. I don't think the *spirit* of such is necessarily bad. But the way they go about it is toxic. Likewise, it's inherently racist, trying to provide benefits to only black people. I originally supported 'all lives matter' until I had learned it was yet another dogwhistle for the right-wing hate groups.\n\n>Do you see any \"Nazis\" or \"White Supremacists\" doing this, despite having superior numbers? If not, why not?\n\nI have, actually. The nazis and white supremacist actually recently *killed* someone. Rather than just rioting. Likewise, many such nazis and white surpremacists are part of the police force, which doe things like this constantly. There is also, of course, horrendously racist and anti-freedom ideals that they push. They're no better than BLM. Both are despicable groups.",

If you want to be the most 'uncensorable' then you'd want to host your own hub, much like what I do (I host my ZeroMe profile on KaffieHub, which I own). However, if a particular site, like ZeroMe (the client) gets attacked, every hub is safe since they're separate sites. Though a compromised site *could* have it's code modified to act on the users' behalf and delete their content or modify it in a particular way. Of course, users can clone their own client and then be certain it's safe, negating the attack entirely.\n\nI think a manual backup option would be nice. For those who want auto-backups, they can just do so on their machine. Those who want to just backup a particular thing can do that.",

It will show full identity including hash.\n\nI couldn't see the page, but this is almost certainly the answer. CryptoID is based on KaffieID and allows for changeable usernames with no check for uniqueness. So many people can have nofish@crypoid.bit or nofish@kaffie.bit. Of course, their auth_addresses will differ. ZeroID, on the other hand, checks for name uniqueness, which means you can be certain no one shares an @ZeroID.bit name (unless nofish acts maliciously).",

And that many gay couples *can* reproduce, if one partner is also transsexual. Likewise, by introducing this as law, you're encouraging inequality, restriction of rights/freedom, and discrimination based on biological characteristics. Is this really what you support?\n\nPersonally my view is that 'marriage' should be abolished entirely. it serves no legal purpose. Have a ceremony or ritual or w/e if you want. But remove it from the legal system. There's no point in it.\n\nLikewise, unmarried people are entirely capable of having kids. And gay/infertile people can easily adopt.\n\n>gay people could even enter this with the opposite sex, surely it’s not that unbearable (lol?)\n\nGo ahead and get into a gay relationship. Surely it's not that unbearable (lol?). It goes against biology. Asking gay people to be straight is like asking straight people to be gay. It just doesn't work. That whole idea goes against biology itself.\n\n>What do you think about this idle though of mine? Good idea? \n\nVery bad idea.

In fact, studies show the opposite: that sex has very little to do with engaging in cultural and social norms. The reality is that men tend to do things other men do, and women tend to do things other women do. Regardless of what those things might be.

Also, I'm testing out Kaffiene Search from the address bar and zero:// doesn't seem to work. I have Kaffiene set as the default search engine in Firefox.\n\nThat's because it's not a feature of kaffiene itself. Please visit [here.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit/test.html) Click \"register protocol\" to set it up. And then you can use that page to test whether you have everything set up right. Basically what it does is set the site to be the default web 'search' for a particular protocol (namely zero://) so when you enter that in your browser it \"searches\" kaffie.bit, and kaffie.bit then redirects you to the proper site.\n\nKaffiene, on the other hand, has an option for having a search engine in your browser, which you've obviously found. All that does is add it as an extra search engine.",
