				"body": "> [c0der](#comment_1_1puKtcLtsbvEgJQPqRfBDWhjES2GboEDN): It is a rumor there, and another picture which Fang Binxing (the initial developer of GFW) denied this in Wechat, but the denial seems fake.The talk to the Shadossocks developer make her left and delete project. Currently it is maintained by others (source code can be backtracked in project's commitments and forked project). It also have a branch named SSR, which is stronger.I do believe GFW will eventually have the skill to recognize and block Shadowsocks, as long as they gather enough information (with machine learning?). Even this rumor is fake, it's better to keep multiple tool to meet the worst case.The worst case will be government disconnect China from global Internet. At that time, any tools will become useless, even Shadowsocks.\n\nYes, if government want to launch a movement of great purge, the door will be closed quickly. However China need internet to support it's enconomy now. The goverment also need to attract foreign company investment to get $. The door can not be closed completely. All they want now is to deprive the freedom of chinese people to access internet. It's too bad ... :(",
