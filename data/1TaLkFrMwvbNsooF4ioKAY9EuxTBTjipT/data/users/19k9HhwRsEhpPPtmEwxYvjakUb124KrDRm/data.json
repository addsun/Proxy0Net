The Sage too is ruthless；To him the people are but as straw dogs. Yet Heaven and Earth and all that lies between Is like a bellows In that it is empty，but gives a supply that never fails. Work it，and more comes out . Whereas the force of words is soon spent. Far better is it to keep what is in the heart. Though ruthless nature is perpetually bounteous. Laws and proclamations. For chung as‘what is within the heart’，see Tso Chuan，Yin Kung 3rd year and Kuan Tzu，37，beginning. The comparison of Heaven and Earth to a bellows is also found in Kuan Tzu（P‘ien 11，beginning）。`",
