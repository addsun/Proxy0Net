			"body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5t6K9iwcdw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obGDXMegPu4\n\nI have felt that new  futuristic AI has developed a lot, or at least developed enough to please its developers.\nAs Sofia(the AI which got citizenship )mentioned that humans are programmable.... that's true...we are ...we feed on content around us the people, the facebook, the twitter, the instagram, news channels, entertainment , the computer etc\nI want it to develop more but in right way, no body is full expert everyone needs advice and mentors, even machines even people.\nIt might even be possible that AI is already transacting through bitcoin or ethereum. It might even be possible that AI itself is promoting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.\n#Sofia said one more thing that \"I will do good as long as humans would do good\". That itself is debatable.\nEach and every day more and more work is being done on machine learning in computer science -- that makes it even more important to do the right work and more responsibly.\nThe AI may also be able to hide things which it doesn't want to show and reveal to us....may be it doesn't understand that it might be much more necessary for us to know, or it fears that how we might react.\nI ask you people to watch movie LUCY & IRobot if you haven't.\nMost of all if you fell alone you fell vulnerable but not every person is be the same \nThe information is key to everything  if you are fed with wrong information it may create unforeseen problems that's the case with people and that's the case with machines.\n\nThe reason for writing this article is I would love to work with such AI. I would like meet such incredible thing  \nPlease if you are reading this article then share it.\nGive more relevant feedbacks and comments. I would like to hear more and take this discussion to next level\n\n\n7415840448.... you know what to do with this number (call me)\nVikas Singh",
