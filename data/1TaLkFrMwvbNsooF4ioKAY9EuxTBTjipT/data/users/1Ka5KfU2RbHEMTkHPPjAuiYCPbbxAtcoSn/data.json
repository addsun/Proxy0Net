Some languages have much in common with other languages, therefore making those other languages easier to learn if you wanted to learn a third language. Some languages expand your mental idea's/state by being more different semantically, grammatically, and pragmatically than your native language. There are many others. Esperanto hits many of these.\n\nBullshit my man, somewhere around to 10 million people talk esperanto. Now let's look at french: 274 millions. \nOnly difference is one group are pseudo-intellectual faggot while the other is an ethno-linguistic group, which pseudo intellectual faggots tend not to like.",
