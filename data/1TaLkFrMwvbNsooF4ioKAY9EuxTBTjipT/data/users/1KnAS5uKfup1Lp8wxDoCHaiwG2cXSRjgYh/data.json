It's because ss was not design to deal with such a situation.\nMy suggestion is, don't use anyone of ss family, at least recently, don't. ss or ssr, just don't use them neither. China's anti-anti-GFW strategy has periods. Recently, it's seems to be ss. I don't wanna try if it is truth by myself. You may try ss/ssr again after a month or two. If it's really has problem, you'll be blocked. But police will not after you.",

SSR with obfs-ing is much more harder to detect.\n\nYes, that's right. But still detectable.\nbreakwa11 don't wanna open the source code of the ssr at the first time. cuz once it public to the world, GFW can learn how to deal with it.",

Cause I didn't see him after he's live show of \"drink tea\".\nRule number 1, don't selfie or live show when you caught by police.\nRule number 2, don't use shadowsocks recently, even ssr. ssr is much more safer then ss, but still has its risk.",
