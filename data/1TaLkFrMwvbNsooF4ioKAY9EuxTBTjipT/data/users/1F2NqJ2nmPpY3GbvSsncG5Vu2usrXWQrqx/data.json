Even if you actively tried to remove it the content would still be floating around between nodes because of a method you provided. Very few legal systems would find you completely innocent thanks to the Hollywood established notion that a site operator is de facto responsible for all content on the site. Your only saving grace may be the definition of a site operator in the context of a decentralized hosting model.\n\nMorally though you haven't done anything wrong based on free speech. You didn't upload it and you (hopefully) aren't willingly viewing it if you ever come across it. Trying to remove it would violate free speech but since the content is deeply immoral to begin with nobody except perhaps the uploader would blame you for it, you are simply contributing to maintaing a moral standard for humanity.\n\nThe issue becomes more complex if you were to create something like a censorship proof evidence host, in which case the moral legitimacy would need to be discussed since the purpose behind the upload is different. The evidence may be intended for use in court to prosecute a particularly resourceful party, yet the victims and acts are made public forever. Clearly the offender/offenders must be stopped, but if previous cases have failed due to disappearing evidence then does publication of the content in question outweigh the privacy of the victims in favor of stopping future crimes?",
