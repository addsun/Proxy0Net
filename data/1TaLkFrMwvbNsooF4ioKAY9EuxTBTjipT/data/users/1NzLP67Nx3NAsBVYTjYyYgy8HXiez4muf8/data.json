But yeah, the idea is exactly as above: it's just a small program running, and when you hit a nice combo (you can set the minimum) of keyboard shortcuts, an announcer yells something like \"Monster Combo!\" and a counter and the work \"Monster Combo!\" appear at the top left of your screen for a short while then disappear. Something to that effect is what I'm thinking.\n\nThoughts?",
