			"body": "I'm having trouble publish my newly-created site so that others could visit it. When I click sign & publish it says \"Your network connection is restricted. Please open 15441 port on your router to make your site accessible for everyone\". But in the FAQ https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/ it says opening new port is optional. I'm using company network and I don't have access to the router configuration. What should I do now?",
