Repeal of Net Neutrality is going to create a gap in the market. There will be existing infrastructure that will try to implement tiers, yet there will still be new protocols and technical workarounds to censorship. In fact it was Ajit Pai who voted to deregulate and extend the range capabilites of unlicensed microwave spectrum for point to point backhaul. So maybe Ajit is for the small ISPs who are not owned by media oligarchs. Time will tell, I just know violence and threats are never the answer. \n\nLove More\nHack More",
