I wasn't sure if I should have made it an Answer instead of a comment, though, So I just did it as a comment.\n\nThanks! For anyone wondering we ended up just sharing the private key of the production zite between each of us, but devving on separate copies of the zite each. We'll probably keep the main zite on its own git branch as well.",

I'm just scratching my head wondering if this will require a re-write of the entire thing .. lolÂ \n\nThe UI would be the same, and files would still be accessed via Big Files. Saving video data, loading video metadata and the locations of the videos would need to be reworked in a merger sense. \n\nThis would definitely be one of those features to get done early though, as the current set of videos would need to be split up into merger sites (by channel), then that metadata would be placed into its own merger site. As multiple sites can use merger sites as a backend, you could simply fork the current site, work on merger functionality separately, then when it's all ready to go, merge it into the main site and it should be able to access everything and post new content.\n\nA nice introduction to working with merger sites can be found inside imachug's [Truth About ZeroNet](https://github.com/krixano/ZeroNet-Dev-Center/issues/28) (clearnet) tutorial series.\n\n> Now that I think about it, I'm also really glad I used Base64 instead of a folder/file upload. Base64 fits nicely into user/data.json .. and you can edit/delete it as many times as you like without adding/removing any additional files.\n\nA much cleaner solution than having thumbnails cast across the site files. Good idea :)",
