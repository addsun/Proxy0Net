That way, they don't end up taking all of the space in the list!\n\nis included click on a merged site name and drop-down  menu is closed.......with the title MERGED SITES: You can close merged sites....You must click only on the category name e.g ZEROME: MERGED ...",

You can also put posts that other people have tagged you in on your timeline. Otherwise, there isn't that much different, except I guess it also kinda prioritizes friends rather than everything being public (but you can make everything on your profile public if you want to. You can also make only a few posts public and some not, etc). And there's no following people, either you're friends (in which case both people have to agree on this) or you're not. [...]\n\nthat is that what i want",
