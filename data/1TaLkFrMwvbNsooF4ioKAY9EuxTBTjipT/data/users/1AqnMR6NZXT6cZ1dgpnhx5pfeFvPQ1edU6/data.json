Perhaps on [0git](http://127.0.0.1:43110/0git.bit)?",

However, due to how ZeroNet handles the data, there's a decent risk of overwriting your original IDs, losing their private keys and locking you out of your identity forever. Try checking out [this thread](/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1_17AMQVbBa12XB3xFWKDnP2dCEx92TaiY7X)  and making some edits of your own. Make a backup first, of course.\n\nAs far as obtaining new ZeroIDs, the easy way is to make a new instance of ZeroNet, obtain the ID you want, save a copy of that ```users.json```, and delete the extra instance. Make sure not to overwrite any jsons; doing so will lose you your keys.",
