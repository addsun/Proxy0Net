Believe it or not, it's inevitable that we're all going to mix around. With advancing technologies, it has become far, far easier to contact a person from the other side of the planet, then travel to them under a few days. Simply saying multiculturalism will never work is pretty foolish. All it takes is for some compromised on all sides, which Australia has managed well. \n\nWe see all around the world how authoritarian governments try to prevent multiculturalism, but all they're doing is slowing the inevitable. \n\n> [planespherev3](#comment_253_1HYB4Pe6irbQgDbeKm1zeFD7M8pdbksFeS): Multiculturalism is cool, until it isn't, ...

If you break the law, you should be punished under the law. That is what happens in Australia, and I'd expect in the rest of the world too.\n\n> [planespherev3](#comment_253_1HYB4Pe6irbQgDbeKm1zeFD7M8pdbksFeS): This is multiculturalism.\n\nI disagree, Australian multiculturalism is pretty nice.
