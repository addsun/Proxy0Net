			"body": "I'm currently running a ZeroNet proxy, but I have a problem with how it handles big files.\n&nbsp;\nAt the moment, every time a user clicks on a video file that isn't being actively seeded by the proxy, it will automatically start downloading the file into the hard drive of the proxy server.\n&nbsp;\nThat means that, given a sufficient amount of time and sufficient amount of users, the hard drive will eventually be overloaded. This will discourage ZeroNet proxies from hosting zites that have big files on them. \n&nbsp;\nEven with the 'help share and distribute big files' option disabled, you're still forced to download and seed the videos/files to your hard drive, every time you click on one. It doesn't allow you to simply stream the videos/files from the currently active peers/seeders.\n&nbsp;\nI'm starting to believe that this is the reason why Proxies have been vanishing. Proxies are a great way to introduce people to ZeroNet.",

			"title": "/r/CryptoUBI - Making Universal Basic Income become a Reality",
			"body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoUBI/\n&nbsp;\nLooks like this is gonna be my favourite reddit for a while.. ^^\n&nbsp;\nCan't believe I'm gonna be 25 this year. I presume a lot of us would have ditched our primary school dreams of going to Mars by now. After all, how will governments ever scrape up enough money for a Mars colony, when there's autonomous drones, tanks and bombs yet to be hauled through the middle east? Surely we can settle for a more realistic sort of milestone for mankind .. such as eradicating wealth inequality. \n&nbsp;\n.. But by the looks of it, most of us have already given up on that one as well.\n&nbsp;\nI'm not one of those people. Think about it - we've had the enlightenment, the industrial revolution. People used to starve to death back in the old days, but nowadays obesity is more of a problem, even in third world countries. \n&nbsp;\nA UBI would no doubt be the first step towards building a world in which our biggest worry will literally be, not knowing what to do with our spare time. Our precarious, globalized, debt-based economy is no longer working for us. The vast majority of us are already living on 'non-existent money'.. except, you'll be re-paying the elite for as long as you live, unless you're privileged enough to be part of this upper class.\n&nbsp;\nThe great thing about using cryptocurrencies to make this dream come a reality, as opposed to relying on governments, is that it puts power directly in the hands of the people. You've probably already heard about Venezuela - the infamous socialist trainwreck. That's actually where I used to live..\n&nbsp;\nMy dad also used to be a diplomat, and once had a gig working as a translator for Putin and Chavez. Back in 2009, me and my mum went on holiday to Russia. Dad took me on a tour through the Venezuelan embassy in Moscow.\n&nbsp;\nOne thing that struck me the most about the people who worked there, was just how materialistic they all seemed. Dad used to take out cash from out of his wallet while we were at the petrol stations and wave it around before getting into his Range rover. He claims to be a socialist, but ironically enough, the only reason he decided to work as a diplomat in the first place, was so that he could live the life of a rockstar. Fancy suits, drinks, prostitutes... \n&nbsp;\nI should add, he no longer works at the embassies anymore, he's unemployed. Venezuela was a failed experiment, no doubt, but to think that the blame lies within the 'generosity' of a government who only wanted to help its struggling working class, is a big mistake. Just because a government claims to be 'for the people', doesn't mean they have to keep their promises. If you wanna get rich in Venezuela, work for the government.\n&nbsp;\n..anywhoo, we probably need our own CryptoUBI talk here on ZeroNet, although we still seem to be a very small community. Let's do something awesome. Pessimism is a waste of time. I should add, I'm an optimistic pessimist. I'm pretty sure I think the world sucks, but I'm also pretty sure we can fix that.",

I mean ... why else would anybody really go college, if it weren't for the money?\n&nbsp;\nThere's only one classmate that I've ever met who genuinely looked like he gave a fuck about programming.

			"title": "What I think of the world today ...",
			"body": "Frankly, I think the world sucks. I don't identify with any political group. The alt-right, antifa, ... sharia.. ... conservatism, christianity.... they can go screw themselves, for all I care.\n&nbsp;\nMy only hope is that we can become a spacefaring Type-I civilization, whose only currency is matter and energy. Everybody is free to live the lives they want to live. Nobody can impose their way of life on others. We can all wake up in the morning and smoke weed and listen to Bob Marley, or go to the movies every day ... or stay up all night writing code ... or play virtual reality video games ....... or travel the world, the solar system.... ..... the galaxy. Ya know.. just be Normal. \n&nbsp;\n... Of course, history shows us that societies usually don't work out that simply. Sometimes, people may even be offended by your version of 'freedom'... as has been the case with recreational drug users, just to give an example... or people being naked in public..... ........ or people hunting animals for food. Sometimes, people have different versions of freedom altogether.\n&nbsp;\nAt the heart of all this is scarcity, and ego. Not even self-proclaimed freedom fighters are immune to this disease, which is probably why you'd never catch me dead at a Gay Rights rally ... or wearing Greenpeace, PETA stickers ... even though I'm an LGBT vegetarian.\n&nbsp;\nMy first dose of politics and philosophy would no doubt have been taken at the age of 9 in Germany, when my dad talked to me about how slaughterhouses worked. Since then, I've kinda earned a reputation for being an animal lover on my primary school playgrounds. Animal rights became my thing..\n&nbsp;\nThen again, as I grew older and witnessed news coverage of the war in the middle east, the refugee crisis, etc. it became apparent that there's little hope to be found in the animal rights movement, considering how awfully we already treat members of our own species. Sometimes we even treat people worse than we treat animals. Try talking to somebody about Saving the Whales. Then try talking to them about Saving the Refugees...\n&nbsp;\nThe reason we cannot save all refugees is because there's scarcity in Europe, and a war of Egos in the middle east.. and the reason we cannot save all whales is because, some people eat them. They use them as a source of chemical energy.. to sustain their own bodies.\n&nbsp;\nScarcity even explains racism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc. After all, Trump and Brexit are all a byproduct of a new underclass (i.e. The Precariat) that is facing economic uncertainty amidst globalization, automation, job loss.. lower benefits, lower wages, etc. . and so they find a way to lash out their frustrations at the world. \n&nbsp;\nMight also have something to do with the fact that politicians were quick to rally up behind Gay Marriage and Transgender anti-discrimination laws, without addressing more urgent issues such as wealth inequality, poverty, homelessness, etc... all of which are issues that actually affect LGBT and ethnic minorities more often than the rest. I'd take Basic Income, affordable housing, affordable health care.. over gay marriage, any day. Growing up with non-accepting parents, my biggest issue was by far was not having enough money, and not having a place I could call my own .... not 'sexism, racism, etc'. People in New Zealand have actually treated me pretty decently.\n&nbsp;\nMaybe this is why gays and trans have received so much hate as of lately. The ones who get the most attention are often rich college kids who dye their hair and wear stickers and start flame wars on social media, not because they really care about the disadvantaged... but because, hey.. Identity Politics is fun. Feeding the homeless is not.\n&nbsp;\nThis gives us all a bad image... unfortunately.\n&nbsp;\nAnywhoo. In conclusion, Violence, protests, whining, flaming.. won't really solve this problem.\n&nbsp;\nOur only hope is technology, science.. and reason. Hell .. technology might even bring us global vegetarianism and animal rights, that is .. if we can create artificial lab-grown meat that is healthier, cheaper and tastier than the real thing. \n&nbsp;\nIf there's a problem, throw technology at it. That's kinda what ZeroNet is about, too. Don't join political parties, don't waste your breath.. don't try too hard to argue with people and convince them ... and for god's sakes, don't throw your life away fighting pointless wars. \n&nbsp;\nBe who you wanna be, don't let people tell you how to live your life, and vice versa. The right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If there's a universal morality, that would have to be it.",

			"title": "Does programming change your way of thinking?",
			"body": "In my experience, one thing that software programming has opened my eyes to.. is the fact that the entire world is basically a program, albeit not so much binary/digital .. as it is analog. Nothing is 1 or 0, there's always a margin of error, always that wiggling room.. always that random number.. but things have a tendency to gravitate towards a certain set of rules, not just the laws of physics.\n&nbsp;\ne.g. \n//Laws of physics.\nIf (the temperature of water < 0c ) { water turns to Ice }. \nIf (you collide head on with a car on a highway) { your total collision speed = (the speed of your car + the speed of the car you collided with)}\n&nbsp;\n//Laws of the Earth, but possibly also tied to the laws of physics (availability of matter and energy, throughout space and time)?\nIf (demand for a product > supply of said product) { if ( business owner can afford risks ) { push prices up } else { go out of business} }. \nif (hemisphere == southern and month of the year == 9) { trees start to blossom }\n&nbsp;\nSo really, if you can program, if you can 'hack'.. you should be able to do anything. (I should add ..Hacking doesn't really have an exact definition... It's more loosely defined as 'doing things unconventionally' or 'doing things you're not supposed to do' or 'solving a problem'). \n&nbsp;\nYet another reason not to tie yourself down to a particular job / career, and allow yourself to be free to explore the world as a whole. Become a hacker of life itself. \n&nbsp;\n.. of course, then there's the issue of needing enough money in order for you to have the freedom to do the things you wanna do, and not end up homeless and on the streets .... but .. surely enough, there's gotta be a hack for that, too.",

			"title": "Beware of the Binary Options scam",
			"body": "Not so long ago, I'd actually received a call on my smartphone... New Zealand number, apparently... from a lady telling me that I had expressed interest in 'trading and investments' with their company.\n&nbsp;\nKnowing that it was a scam, I hung up the phone at the time .. and yet, the phone calls persisted. \n&nbsp;\nMe and my friend came up with an idea; we would get her to visit a fake blog that I created. The fake blog was hosted on a Nginx webserver, and was running a cryptocurreny miner at 100% speed and CPU usage. We were just fucking around though.. nothing serious..\n&nbsp;\nDidn't take long for us to convince the lady on the phone to click on our link. The Nginx access log revealed her IP. It turned out, the call originated from the Philippines, not New Zealand. She had a slightly American accent .. and was pretty fluent at it .. I presume she studied English in her home country with the help of an American teacher.\n&nbsp;\n..fast forward into December 2017.. I've now become the target of almost non-stop calls. I've had to install Call Blocker on my phone, but even that hasn't helped; the scammers are known to use number spoofers. I've had calls originating from London, Texas, Australia.. New Zealand.. everywhere in the world. I've had callers with numbers like +000000 ... or even just '1'.\n&nbsp;\nIt's as if they were all reading from a script. I would get men, women from all around the world asking me to make a $250 deposit and start 'betting' on rising and falling prices of stocks / assets / etc. They'd take you to a webpage that looks something like the LCD screens on Wall Street.\n&nbsp;\nAfter doing a bit of research on the matter, it turns out that this Binary Options trend is relatively new and has actually become quite a popular 'online investment game' ... which has practically filled the void left over by the crackdown on online gambling. This isn't your typical 'nigerian scam' ... these aren't poor people in Africa trying to make a quick buck, it's a multi-million dollar business, and even intelligent people are falling for it. Lawyers, doctors .. elderly people on a pension .. you name it. \n&nbsp;\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFH-c-PwQ5M\n&nbsp;\nThe way it works is.. when you sign up with them, you're basically agreeing to taking a risk. They'll tell you that you're gonna make a lot of money, sure. But the Terms and Conditions they get you to agree on still indicate the Risk factor, and it's this risk factor they take advantage of in order to get away with their ill-gotten gains. So you're practically gambling, not investing.. and the odds are purposely rigged so that these websites can profit and walk away with your money.. and there's absolutely nothing authorities can do about it because it's overseas. Chances are, a lot of these trades and stock prices are random numbers, and aren't real.",

			"body": "Most of these projects I've kinda already started working on, though admittedly, I'm sometimes guilty of shuffling between unfinished stuff here and then..\n&nbsp;\nIt's too damn hot right now, too. I don't think I can stand the heat in this bedroom anymore.. it was a blessing during winter time, but in the summer it's a curse. Even my PC fans are going wild. It makes me nauseous and unable to think straight. I'm seriously considering getting out of this house and going to a public library during the daytime, program there instead, since they have air conditioning. Chances are, they'll probably have dreamweaver and stuff like that .. it'll be good to take a break from gedit and notepadqq.. ... as much as I love Linux.\n&nbsp;\nAnywhoo.. here's some stuff I'd like to be able to accomplish in the short term:\n- **encoder.zerocat.eu** : A free node.js video encoding website/server piped through a Nginx proxy, with some sort of a file storage regulator, so that clients don't DDoS the thing uploading too many files. Let the servers do the dirty work, give my PC another break. No ads, no mining. Gotta have a link to ZeroNet though, and my proxy... talk about movement building. \n- **im.not.as.good.as** : (iNaga) An open source, Actionscript framework that allows you to control animations through simple functions with parameters and options ranging from the very basic, to the more advanced and sophisticated. \n\n=> Basically, you have an environment full of 2-dimensional AI marionettes and toys, and it's all yours to command. \n=>The characters are structured so as to enable ease of assembly and disassembly, just like 2d lego. \n=> The style is akin to a hybrid between Anime and South Park. \n=> Makes creating cartoons as easy as playing video games. This is suitable for people who feel they have good ideas and a good storyline, but don't want to have to put in the time and effort that is normally involved in animating.. (besides.. spending more time and effort on your videos doesn't necessarily equate to move views and likes, either.... I mean it does, but.... you're still handicapped compared to YouTubers who just do commentary over video game footage and then live off the ad-revenue.. so get those animations pumping and bring story-telling back to the internets..!)\n&nbsp;\n- **first-contact** : Dating app that matches you up with people of your preferred gender, who share similar facial characteristics with you ... based on the facial similarity theory of sexual & romatic attraction. Inspired by the Fermi Paradox; there's nowhere in hell that we are alone, we're not that special .. there's gotta be someone just like us, somewhere out there in the universe.. but why the hell won't they visit?\n\n=> Takes advantage of the blockchain in order to reduce server costs. \n=> Respects your privacy.. images aren't stored on the blockchain ..... rather, facial shape coordinates are stored as public keys, and then paired with other public keys in order to create matches. It is then up to both parties to agree to initiate contact.\n=> Features real-time Virtual Social Clubs, basically a mmorpg where you get to meet people and mingle and chat. None of that second life bullshit.. has to be grounded in reality, you can't choose how you look like. There's no dragons and night elves with big boobs. No cheating, or bad karma will follow!\n=> The clear-net, server-side applications will run cryptocurrency miners in order to reward the creators, and help fund whatever server costs there may be, obviously. If it does make it big, none of it will be spent on mansions or luxury yachts - the money will be pumped straight into cryptocurrency-based Universal Basic Income dividends. Let machines and AI create paradise on Earth so that humans can live free and without having to worry about money, move on to more important matters like the stopping the hypothetical Heat Death of the Universe.. simple.\n&nbsp;\n- **In the long term** I'd also like to work on robots, which I've already done, so I mean.. continue working on them. It would be great to have an affordable, open-source personal-helper robot that can follow you around and carry groceries and all that.. and fix your computer. And provide home surveillance. And show you low resolution mid-air videos (femto-second IR lasers). And bring you a beer. And crack it open. And talk to you. Kinda like R2D2. \n\n=> Uses machine learning. The brain of the robot will consist of various bootstrap 'modules' that keep stacking up with time and automatic updates. For example, the human brain might have 'modules' that handle Love-making, eating, sleeping.. ... curiosity... speech, emotion... visual processing... humor... well, same with the robot. Automatic updates will help the number of modules grow, which helps the robot evolve and gain complexity. You could even create modules that allows the robot to create its own modules.\n&nbsp;\nAnd yeah, it's all gotta be open source. I guess it's my way of paying for all the free movies I've watched and the cracked software i've downloaded. Also, money sucks.. the sooner we can do away with it, the better. People aren't lazy.. they just tend to be more motivated to do shit that they care about.",

Options are also pretty basic right now.. pretty much just compresses your video to 3 different resolutions.\n&nbsp;\nJobs are queued, and the server only encodes one video at a time.\n&nbsp;\nYou can also run this server on a local network on your own computer. Pretty convenient if e.g. say you have multiple computers at home, but only one computer is used for video encoding.. you just add the files to it via URL ip address. Just as you would run ZeroNet. Just modify the permissions/size/file-storage-time/POST request limits.",

It's online gambling i.e. the house always wins.. but this particular breed disguises itself as investment firms.. promising profits (which you'll obviously never receive.. you won't even be able to withdraw your initial $250 deposit, unless you can get a friend to sign up to the scheme, thus perpetuating it).\n&nbsp;\nIt's not a harmless Nigerian-type scam by any means. One Canadian man has been driven to suicide, not long ago.. after losing thousands.\n&nbsp;\nSome of the telemarketers actually work for these companies full time and earn good money. Yesterday, one of them even tried to get me to consent to remote-access to my PC (I've been leading them on for a while.. on the phone).\n&nbsp;\nThey've finally exposed their one vulnerability - Remote access. The trick will be to set up a virtual machine for baiting purposes, then trick them into installing spyware. How about hacking their entire call-centers, running cryptocurrency miners inside them ... then making all of their information public? Use the revenue to support victims.\n&nbsp;\nThat would be glorious.",

Any torrent submitted by Kopyjane or Kopykate will be web-seeded.\n\nA big problem we have is that **people are too lazy to seed..** they just expect others to do all the seeding. And because we can't borrow any peers from BitTorrent clients, we kinda have to start from scratch.\n\nSo the solution is to use HTTP web-seeds as a temporary backup, at least until the site goes viral. In fact, every time you stream the videos - you are simultaneously seeding them .. so the more viewers we get, the better.\n\nSite is also available at  http://kopykate.ga/ .. which will Forward the link to a ZeroNet proxy. \n\n**REGARDING UPLOADING - Because this is not YouTube.com, videos need to be seeded by the user in order to play. Don't close the tab of the Upload page until you've added your magnet link to the Webtorrent Desktop client. Use the x264 and AAC codecs because we can't encode on your behalf, as this is not a webserver.**\n\n**REGARDING WEBRTC - It will not work in Tor browser.

Now on Kopy Kate OFFICIAL I've managed to do streaming down and uploading videos ! Fucking great. And as always: Once you've managed it, it doesn't appear that hard ;) Here's how I've done upload on Kopy Kate OFFICIAL:\n> \n> Using firefox browser - new, private window (before making sure webRTC is on by config:about - media.peerconnection.enable 'true')\n> Going on Kopy Kate OFFICIAL - http://127.0.0.1:43110/1aCq7GiJfUfGZ4GftjYaYbsEngPFzcxvN/\n> right click on \"+ Upload new video!\" and open new tab with it\n> Under \"Upload .mp4 file:\" click on \"search\", look for the video you want to upload and confirm with \"ok\"\n> Type in Title, description, look online fore a nice pic of your video and copy its link and paste it in the respective field, choose the video category\n> Left-click, hold, drag & drop the \"magnet link\" into your WebTorrent.desktop - here's a screenshot how it looks like: https://abload.de/img/kopykateofficialuploa9ekiu.png\n> wait until WebTorrent.desktop is done with loading\n> Then on the upload page of Kopy Kate OFFICIAL click on the \"add video\" button\n> \n> THAT'S IT !!! SUCCESS !!! You can tell by yourself when you visit Kopy Kate OFFICIAL after the upload, see your video in the list, click on it and then on Kopy Kate OFFICIAL you'll see how your video is being streamed down and has at least 1 peer.\n> Ah, and here's the link of my first successful video upload: http://127.0.0.1:43110/1aCq7GiJfUfGZ4GftjYaYbsEngPFzcxvN/?Topic:6_1PvAednzaMJiuMz1SD5wF3m3Hx7SK75zHv/Reclaim+your+freedom+with+free+libre+software+now+Richard+Stallman+of+Free+Software+Movement\n> When I find the time for it, I will re-shape my starting posting here to be more like a tutorial...\n\nYour computer must be switched off right now? :p\n\nI'll have to do a tutorial on how to create a Webseed, as well. Of course, it's only a matter of adding ' &ws= ' to the end of your magnet link and then adding a HTTPS:// link to the exact same file that the torrent contains, but stored inside a webserver.. then previewing this magnet link in Instant.io, downloading the resulting .torrent file .. and uploading the torrent file into the same folder as the original .mp4 you have on your webserver. Of course, this can still confuse a lot of people .. \n\nYou can actually use Dropbox to create webseeds. At least, until they fix the exploit which allows you to create direct links by using the dl.dropboxusercontent.com domain. \n\nI'm using a VPS for my seedbox and it's got about 200GB storage, for $9 a month (6 USD). So .. it could fit about 220 movies.. or 500-700 TV-show episodes. And I'm friends with the owner of the VPS provider.\n\nWhat I like about it is that I can just go to a friend's house and then just stream the movies I want instead of carrying a USB drive or installing uTorrent on their computer.. so it kinda benefits me as well. :p",

But of course that defeats the whole point of having them webseeded in the first place.\n> Edit: Figured it out. KopyKate auto-filled the magnet link and using the magnet doesn't seem to work, but pasting in the link to the .torrent (like I did originally to load the upload page) allows the video to be webseeded properly.

I'm just scratching my head wondering if this will require a re-write of the entire thing .. lol\n&nbsp;\nNow that I think about it, I'm also really glad I used Base64 instead of a folder/file upload.
