And that presents a problem, in that while anyone can host a site, anyone trying to download it has to go through the centralized isps at some point.  and that means that an isp can block any data relating to a zeronet site, or worst case, zeronet as a whole.\n\nwhat we need to do is completely reinvent networking.  everyone needs to be their own isp.  i am aware that there are obstacles, and i'm still trying to figure this all out myself.\n\nit'd be a great topic for zerocon, but i can't afford to travel to europe atm.  i will update when i have more.",
