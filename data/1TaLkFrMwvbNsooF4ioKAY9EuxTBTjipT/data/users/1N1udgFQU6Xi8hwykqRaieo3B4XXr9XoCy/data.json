In distributed systems you absolutely have to have a web of trust. Right now we've got some psuedo central registration mechanism. It's brain dead. There's not even a reliable way to identify who to mute, and even if there was, people can just create new identities and it's default trust. There is no such thing as a Mute. \n\nI can understand that stance while zeronet is small and trying to grow. but it's crazy.",

ZeroNet Should choice RIGHT VERSION, some nodes like your machine perhaps does not install php or nginx\n\neh. I think if you're thinking about using ruby or PHP to do anything on zero net, you are thinking in the wrong way. \n\nThere's no \"servers\", there's no central point. If you want to make something on zero net, the point is that you don't have to host a server to run a website. No one's going to universally install a programming language. At best you might hope that ZeroNet will let remote programs use python 2 that it requires, but I would never trust a website with access to that. It would be crazy.",
