It's not relevant atm.\n\nI think it's because the republic, and representative democracy, is the cherished system of the Capital. The capital really took off when republics were instigated in western europa. Today, almost every developed country has a republic as a political system. The reason for it is because it's easier to buy 500 representatives (in a parliament) than a king, a dictator (who are all-powerful) or all the citizens (in this last case,  if the political system is a direct democracy). We know that there is a lot of conflict of interests in the EU institutions, especially in the EU commission and the EU parliament. For us citizens conflicts of interest are a problem, but the capital like them. He is the one buying representatives. \n\nI think the future of the capital (if we don't stop the process one way or another) is not even a republic anymore, but a pure technocracy. Like the European commission which has law initiative in the EU but isn't elected.\n\nLiquid democracy would mean more democracy (although for me there is democracy or there isn't, but i can accept that liquid democracy is somehow better than representative democracy but not as good as direct democracy).\n\nThus, more democracy isn't in the Capital best interest. The Capital would like a pure technocracy (which isn't a democracy at all) better.  That's why mainstream medias, which are owned by the capitalistic class, don't talk about liquid democracy.",

You were not allowed to employ workers. Not only production was affected, distribution was on the basis of what people needed. In many areas money was abolished. People come to the collective store (often churches which had been turned into warehouses) and got what was available. If there were shortages rationing would be introduced to ensure that everyone got their fair share.

In fact, anarchy is only ever achievable if all are free, and free to collaborate and contribute. Not being coerced into contributing into any ways, because if that has to happen, the wealthier will just run off with their money. \n\nYou haven't read what's written a few posts below. During the Revolutionary Catalonia (1937), people were allowed to keep their real property if they wanted to. \n\nI your post you talk about money, money, money and money. (quoting you: \"taxation, taking their money, wealthier, run off with their money, sponsored, platinium Visa card, two cents\"). \n\nDuring revolutionary Catalonia there were some eras which functioned totally without money. So the problem about the wealthier fleeing or the visa in the Ghetto would simply not exist anymore. \n\nSeriously, have you ever considered a world without money?

Without money, we can not have an estimation of the value of items, wheter demanded or given, and that is all it is. And I did read about the revolutionary Catalonia, but to me it is not a good example, having lasted only a few years and being composed of communists and anarchists, which are naturally opposed to each others.\n\n >Without money, we can not have an estimation of the value of items,\n\nWe could if we used other criterias than how much people are willing to pay. Criterium like : are the raw material which compose this item rare or abundant, is the item easy to produce or not, could we manufacture it in large quantity etc... With these criterias, we could address a value to an item, and decide if it must be produced massively and shared, or kept for specific usages. \n\nAlso, in capitalism, some items are not valued, however, they are immensely valuable. One of the best examples is helium, which is cheap but very rare on earth. Or biodiversity on the rainforest. We destroy it but it is a treasure regarding health correlated molecules allowing to cure diseases. \n\n> Money is merely a value attributed to common goods\n\n\nIn every dollar or euro bill, there is speculation, hierarchy, 2 class society, theft, scarcity, greed.............\n\nMoney means circulation of goods,  exchange, and private property. \n\nMoney is opposed to homo sapiens nature. Goods aren't supposed to circulate, but be consumed from the source. Their is no exchange, but sharing. Private property also doesn't exist regarding homo sapiens in his natural state.\n\nAnarchy cannot exist until most of the people are convinced that capitalism is inherently a shitty mode of production. \n\nForcing people to accept anarchy isn't possible. Otherwise they'll always rally to the state and to money.  They must understand the concept, and agree that it would be better than a state and money based society. The breaking point is about 80% of the population. Then nothing will be easier than to change our society to an anarchic one.",

An-cap was a state of development of capitalism, a previous version of it, but still the same system. It exist in the free cities in medieval times and in the far west. I won't even question the value of this system (however regarding the far west there is lot's of criticism to make). It won't happen again, since capitalism move forward, never backward. And forward, there is no an-com, but ultra-liberalism, were you can buy children and be obliged to be euthanized when you're not productive anymore. The only way to stop capitalism isn't to go backward, but to fight capitalism upstream, before it's new evolutions happen. \n\n\n> Complaining they don't do what? I'm not complaining. I'm happy for them. I'm telling you that you can be an an-com today if you want to. But you don't. Only in the comfort of your current environment will you be an an-com. You're not a pioneer. You are waiting for someone to do the dirty work for you. Typical an-com philosophy in other words.\n\nYou can be ancom if you join one of the many anarchist communities around the world, but the standard of living is poor. What's more, if one do so, he is not really fighting capitalism, but fleeing it. \n\nAn-com is something which will need the global social conscience to wake up, and choose an other path. \n\n> The burdon of proof is in your hands.

It's not exactly like you can just ignore the legal system and assume nothing will go wrong. I do think opting out of society as much as possible should be the current goal. And focusing on making free decentralized systems so that the current legal and monetary systems are unneeded. The less support mainstream society has, the easier it'll be to get rid of it. I talked a bit about this on my blog, but I definitely need to do some more in-depth writing. Unfortunately I don't think opting out completely without societal support will ever be possible, as long as you have medical needs or desire new tech.\n> What we really need to get anarchism off the ground and going is lots of funding and resources. Building up networks of anarchist communities, and focusing on cutting ties with major systems. I think ZeroNet can be a key piece of this in terms of tech. No need for dedicated webhosts, no need for ICANN, no big corp tracking or spying, etc. Unfortunately the hardware and physical aspect of it all is much more difficult than the digital portion.

The reason for that is that where there is opportunity, there is money. They just presented a list of the 8 richest men on the planet. I can promise you that he who solves the problem of producing clean and sustainable energy will be on that list. So there is a lot of incentives to get thorium working, and it's still not. So I think it's several decades away, and I don't want to halt innovation in other fields while everybody is trying to get Thorium working.\n\n\nWrong, it exist functionnaly still the end of the 80s (THTR-300), in the form of the pebble bed reactor.\n\nAnd it will exist again in China by the end of 2017 (HTR-PM, which is thorium fully compatible).\n\nBut heh, fossils fuel companies didn't want it because they were clinging to their business.

I fail to see your point though. Is that they need a non-renewable source that comes as a by-product of petroleum industry for cooling? (Helium) Is it that it wasn't financially viable?\n\n\nMy point is that in this capitalist system, it was more profitable (mean make more money) for the fossil fuel industry to take lobbying actions against this technological marvel in order to keep their privileges, instead of allowing it to finish it's development (which was almost done since it produced 423 days). Same example, but more mainstream, with the GM EV1 (\"who killed the electric car\" documentary).\n\nOf course it wasn't financially viable, like the Tesla roadster wasn't viable. A functional prototype rarely is viable. However the Chinese are finalizing the HTR-PM, which is a copy of this THTR-300. So finally we'll see this technology in the capitalist system, but 30 years late, when we could already be far in the post-fossil fuel era. The irony is that now in the USA they want to replace the coal power station boilers with this technology, mostly because the Chinese are using it. So they don't use the stuff since it's the best technology (the concept was invented in 1947 if i remember), but because they don't have any other choice left, since the competition (China), is using it. Petrodollars, which are a consequence of the capitalism system, has strongly something to do with it in my opinion. If there was already 100 reactors of this kind around the world, and many more to come, oil value, thus the dollar value (which is linked to oil since all oil transactions are made in dollars), would already have significantly decreased. \n\nIt's not the only time fossil fuel industry did this, they did it again with the integral fast reactor in the 90s: http://ergosphere.blogspot.no/2010/10/why-integral-fast-reactor-had-to-die.html\n\nAbout the Helium, it's not a problem since it could be replaced (i read it on papers) by Nitrogen, Hydrogen or even air.

That way, it's still decentralized and nothing can ever be removed without everyone's permission and I won't have to look at CP all day\n\nAgreed. That's what happened in freenet. When FMS and Sone were developped, all the pedo stayed on Frost, the former board client, so FMS and Sone don't have pedos. \n\nPedos need a place of their own so they won't bother us. I think they'll stay on freenet because freenet is way more anonymous. \n\nAgain, you can treat pedophilia with psychotherapy IRL, but banning all the pedos sites from the clear and the dark, and they'll just exchange their shit IRL with DVDs, which is worse since they'll get in contact with each other and could create some networks and make new contacts (John Podesta?) and do nasty shit IRL.",

Of course, freedom is a major aspect of the 0net.\n> However a bit part of it is going to be the fact that website admins can still monitor and, well, administrate the content of their own websites, and still hire moderators. Chances are, since most people are actually decent human beings, when it comes to major websites like reddit clones and what not, we are going to see standard moderation when it comes to spam or raids and the like while still having freedom of speech (depending on the moderation, which is still a whole new area to explore later in the life of 0net), which will be quite nice. \n> It does post some issue when it come to legislation which is why, as I said, I believe the media is going to jump on it - anything that cannot be lawingly censored can easily be shown as bad. \n> I think there are way to govern this if necessary - the whole point is, however, that hopefully, for us as a humanity - it won't be.\n\nAbout censorship, the only censorship i tolerate in networks is collective censorship, like in Freenet, which works really well in my opinion. \n\nI think you are talking about child porn. About this, the responsible shouldn't be ZeroNet (or freenet), but the sub-humans that record such material. Also, objectively, the thing most responsible for child porn, after the garbage that do this, is the camera itself. Seriously (i'm not even ironic now), cameras are way more responsible for childporn than the networks that are used to share them. \n\nIf one wants to fight against children porn, he needs to act IRL with tools like strong psychotherapy, chemical castration (for hopeless cases), and severe prison penalties of course. In a way, and that controversial, childporn on the internet could reduce childporn IRL. If it follows the same dynamic as adult porn, it could. Indeed, many men don't even want to move their ass and pick up girls and face rejection, they just watch porn. If we make a parallelism with CP, pedophile who haven't still abused children might neven commit sexual abuses IRL, because they can release (literally) their frustration in front of their computer. Yes you need recorded pedophiles acts in the first place, but pedophilia unfortunately exist since the neolitic revolution, and hopefully, it will disappear one day, but P2P networks won't make it worse until then. Probably better in fact like i said.  \n\nChild porn is an awful phenomenon, but it's also rare (not rare enough i reckon). And i repeat, it must be dealt with IRL, before it happen.\n\nWhat is more problematic is the lack of right to oblivion in P2P internet.  With networks like ZeroNet (and freenet),  nobody will have the right to oblivion anymore. In the clear, it works, you can ask google to remove from index content linked to you private life,  but here, as we know, it's impossible to apply. That could be scary regarding stuff like revenge sex, or voyeurism. \n\nWe could also have passive censorship, like an app that register each sites (like adblockers lists) and classify them as offensive or not, with some scale.",

However, it's more like their own interpretation of those facts. You'll see that the Darwin theory will probably fall in the coming decades.\nDarwin theory emerged in an era when people, especially in the scientific community, were more and more atheist. Thus they projected this atheism into biology. \n\nI prefer to rely on my instinct. That doesn't mean i reject science, but i'll only believe it if anybody can verify.

What do you btw mean with \"never creates anything\"? The point here is about transferring traits between generations.. and that is what you can do with flies. That is what happens in dog kennels and other breeder kind of business. You pick a specimen with a desired trait and then breed it. If the long beak of a bird is good for the natural selection it will develop. This is observable.\n\nI think you didn't understand neo-darwinism. \n\nIn neo-darwinism, there is random mutation in the DNA occuring constantly in the nature (sun ray, natural radioactivity, errors in DNA replication). Most of the time, these errors are bad for the individual (cancers, malformations). However, once in a while, a mutation which brings a positive change is supposed to appear (E.G: feather, warm blood, some useful protein etc...).\n\n\nWhat is done in fruit fly doesn't create a new gene or a new function. It just delete an old one or replicate an old one (hence the 4 wings in a fruit fly experiment), by replicating or displacing a gene. No new function are created, no new design.\n\nAbout the long beak, how can you prove that it's the results of random mutations and not something else? The process is supposed to happen in Thousands of years, thus it's not possible to verify the facts.\n\n\n> \n> Yes, that is true... when something turns out the same even with multiple repetitions with different studies. It is eventually regarded as proven. \n> \n> So a \"feeling\" you have is higher valued than multiple years of studying a subject? I can see why you are open to conspiracies. Because they are masters at manipulating that feeling of yours. Which also is why I am critical of these.. I need more than a feeling. I need some facts. Not just any facts but fact that I deem objective enough. ;)\n\nMultiple years of studying a subject by who? Paid by who? Belonging in which power center? Biased by which beliefs? And in the end, multiple year done by humans, which are psychological creature by essence, and more interested by their own interest and their close group than by the real common good. \n\n\n> Are you seriously believing the earth is flat?\n\nI don't know.

The fact that you cannot see beyond 5 km on the see doesn't mean it's round. \n\n> \n> This is actually something I agree with you. We haven't come far enough.

I guess you have heard of GMO and for instance the golden rice?\n\nWhat your talking about has nothing to do with darwinism. \n\nAbout the dogs, it's not natural or artificial evolution.

It's about random DNA mutation which lead to evolutionary advantages in a specific environment.\n\nDogs are wolves, is basic. What differenciate a race from a species, is that individuals from this particular species can repreduce with each other.

Do the souls of the Jews who destroyed their own planet always incarnate on Earth in Jewish bodies or do they incarnate as other races as well?\n\n.\nThe Earth is the only planet they are allowed to incarnate on, and they always incarnate as Jews. We have to state at that point that it is a big honor for a being to be allowed to incarnate on a planet. There are many examinations to be passed before a being is allowed to incarnate. Due to the crack of Atlantis it was possible that beings incarnated on Earth that within the heavenly order would not have had the maturity to incarnate at all.\n\n.\n5. Were Jesus, Mary, etc. Jewish souls, and if not, why did they incarnate in israel as Jews (or is that disinfo?)\n\n.\nAll stories about Jesus and his parents have been heavily distorted by the Archons and their servants. Jesus is the son of the two Elderer we are in contact with, and he also is incarnated at the moment and is currently two years old. He hasn’t been Jewish back then and did never incarnate in Israel.

My main problem with climate change or whatever it is they are calling it these days is the profound verbal assults you will get if you are skeptical. In science one needs critics for the theory to get vigrously tested. This is not the case for climate change. However, I see first hand that things aren't as they used to, so I haven't really been questioning the whole idea.\n> But when I see this:http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/climate-change-scare-tool-to-destroy-capitalism/\n> It gets me thinking. It would be better if it was an internal document leaked to wikileaks or something though. Just an assertion on a website I haven't heard of isn't very credible. But still it fits well with the globalists narrative.\n\nClimate change is a tool to get to a world government.\n\nWhat is a problem that could be universally shared? Pollution? Poverty? War threat? Not. Really. But climate change is the (supposedly), universal threat, which potentially concern every person on earth.  \n\nThat's why the proponent of a world government have found their perfect problematic to initiate the draft of a world government: the COP21. They will push further and further. ECSC and euratom were draft for the european union. COP21, and other meetings like that, are drafts for a world government. \n\nThey were thinking how to initiate the process since the 60s (there are documented proofs). They even wanted at some point to reunite the world in face of a supposedly alien threat. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQxzWpy7PKg\n\nSeems in the end global warming is more reasonable and plausible.",

A lot between them is very similar. They are very unlike the Confucius based religions. Take Malta for instance... they do not allow for abortion. They will not even save the women if it threatens her life. In Arabic countries you can do abortion if it threatens the woman's life. They believe the spirit doesn't come to the fetus until after 4 month. Which makes the time before that not as important..... but there is cultural differences between countries, areas, families. You can not apply the Saudi Arabia filter on a more liberal country like Lebanon or Tunisia. They are very different. One Muslim is not the same as another Muslim. They are not homogeneous. They are individuals..Disabled had it very though in Christian countries before. It was looked up on them as God's will. That they became disabled because of sins their parents had been made. Disabled was therefore hidden many times or killed. Luther saw for instance some of them as witches or taken by the devil. Stuff like this never happened in the Islamic countries..I have been traveling alone in a North African country. They are very liberal. At least in the urban areas. I could almost say 50% European values. Islam never talk about musts. It talks about what you should... but never explicitly must. If it would save you life it would for instance be okay to eat a medicine made from pigs. Life is precious. If you are sick, travels, are a kid or too old. It is okay not to pray. Christianity is the one talking about musts. It is natural for humans to sin though. So in essence they are kinda similar..What happened was the Enlightenment Movement. It changed the culture (including the religion) in Europe. Before that it could be argued that Islam was more humane than Christianity.\n\nYou seem to conflate Christianity and the Catholic church/ Church of England. Jesus Christ, whether he is the son of god or a very famous man, never talked about musts. \n\nAlso, nice the example with the disabled, but what about the women who are stoned to death and forced to wear a complete veil? \n\nAnyway i don't want to have a debate about Islam. I was in Islamic countries and i understood that they don't consider us as fellow human beings. It's enough for me for not willing to be friend with them.",

It's not me, but the experience of people who were super tolerant and open for decades, and i take their opinion into consideration. \n\nThen you have people who get upset when you say \"hello\", or \"goodbye\" to them, because the prophet said it's salam aleikum, and aleikum salam. You must adapt to be polite but never say a simple thing common to all westerners like \"Hello\". People who think you are disgusting because you eat pork (although i'm a vegetarian myself).

Obviously the use of chemical weapons (crossing 'red line', allowing legal nato regime change) on civilians in full view of the white helmets (soros funded) and countless cameras was because assad's secret fantasy is to watch his country burn from a cell in the Hague, duh     -_- OP is 100% on welfare, food stamps, something, bitching at immigrants, having no clue that he's playing right into the real enemy's hands, the bankers, those globalist elite fucks at the CFR, TLC, etc. that wrote  those immigration policies and push said policies to the limit.

It's a small step, but the first step is often the most important one. \n\nElectronics we can buy, but mostly the cheapest, most mass produced items. \n\nIt seems paradoxical, but mass production of many super cheap items  is the end of capitalism. Because the profit on those more and more mass produced  items tends more and more to nothing in the end. At one critical point, those  items won't  sell anymore, because people don't need like 28 different electronic toothbrush, so the system won't be able to make profit by selling many cheap items with tiny profit on each of them, and the capitalist mode of production will collapse.  See the tendency of the rate of profit to fall:\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall\n\nSo yeah, the way i see it, those who want to save capitalism must buy high end/ high-margin-for-the-producer items, like iphones, or expensive cars,  and buy them regularily, whenever a new one is released. \n\nThose who want to make capitalism die must make the opposite: buy cheap (mass produced with low profit) or second hand stuff.",

Like it's not like the planet is being destroyed, inequalities are bigger than ever, the financial system makes us all slaves, the mode of production itself (capitalism), is horrible. No. All that doesn't really matter.  LGBT rights and gender theory is one of the most important stuff to discuss about. \n\nThis gender theory came from crazy degenerates like Alfred Kinsey. \n\nNo need to have a Phd in Biology to know that if you have XX you are a female, and XY you are a male. \n\nSo there is fluoride in the water, shit spread by planes (chemtrails), stupid and sexual music clips shows at children at a young age (lady gaga, Nicky Minaj etc...), all of this shit create disturbance in the identities of the people, and then some guys like you who haven't clearly identified the source of this say: gender are not defined by birth. \n\nOf course it is defined by birth. Only after eating so much industrial shit, breathing this polluted air, and especially watching this crazy and really non human medias, one can lost feet and think he or she is of the opposite sex. \n\nSince you are not stupid and can probably think in good faith, ask yourself: did the primitive tribes have gender identities troubles? Does the last primitive tribes living on earth have gender identities problems? Of course not. Thus gender identities troubles are not genetic, but only a consequence of this particulary crazy society. Probably the most crazy society in human history.\n\nListen to me, i reject all this progressive shit. Not because i'm a bad nazi or intolerant bastard, but because all of it is a consequence of capitalism in it's final development. There is not LGBT in a primitive tribes. All these guys are lost souls who cannot even correctly point the source of their unhapiness. Maybe because it's easier to spit on some alt rights people than to admit the core of our existence is completely alienated. Same remark for alt right guys who think the problem is the gay or the migrant when the problem is money, hierarchy, the state, division of labor, delegation of power and property. \n\nSince i reject capitalism, i also reject capitalism's culture: progressivism.

I'm eagerly awaiting your answer to eternal happiness.\n\nLots of insults, even if i haven't used one. I don't care about homosexuals and transgender, really. It's a small portion of LGBT which is aggressive towards straight men. It is them who need to calm down. \n\nI am not responsible of your unhapiness, and alt rights aren't either. \n\nIt's alienation. We see our relationships with each other not as interaction between humans, but our interactions are the result of the movement of goods. \n\n\nAbout sexual identities uncertainties, here some post-primitive but pre civilization tribe which doesn't know about it:\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/where-masturbation-and-homosexuality-do-not-exist/265849/\n\nHomosexuality and gender identities uncertainties might have come with the neolitic revolution, 12500 years ago. \n\nIn fact, they might be a consequence of civilization. \n\nAnything that happened after the neolithic revolution is shit. So i don't care if there are example of civilizations with gender identities uncertainties after this neolithic revolution. For me it doesn't proove that homo sapiens can/should have a different gender identity than it's genetic one. \n\n\nCapitalism, since it was born in the 13th centuries, used the power that is in order to propagate. At first it was the monarchy, then nationalism. Currently, the best way for it to propagate seem social democracy and progressivism. \nProgressivism is  capitalism vanguard. It's laboratory. Were it can conceive the next step such as sell you a baby which was grown in a surrogate mother, or sell you surgery for you to change your sexual identity. \n\nIn any case, capitalism, and even civilization, creates problems (gender uncertainties), and then it finds pseudo solutions (surgery, change of gender), which themselves creates even more problems (many transgender people didn't like their sex change and some even committed suicide).\n\nThis mode of production has to stop. Then everything will be much better. Could even be very fine after a transition period.  I'm pretty sure that identities uncertainties won't be a problem anymore. \n\nThose biological cause of transsexualism you talk about might be produced by our fucked up way of life which began 12500 years ago.

Several systems of Gnostic thought present the Demiurge as antagonistic to the will of the Supreme Being: his act of creation occurs in unconscious semblance of the divine model, and thus is fundamentally flawed, or else is formed with the malevolent intention of entrapping aspects of the divine in materiality. Thus, in such systems, the Demiurge acts as a solution to (or, at least possibly, the problem or cause that gives rise to)[citation needed] the problem of evil.\"",

Blacks represent about 13% of the population in the US. However,  blacks commit more murders than whites (look at the statistics). Is murder bullying? No. It is worse. \n\nI am not even making a statement against blacks. I'm against multiculturalism, not blacks. Africa is a gigantic continent:\n\n http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2596783/Why-world-map-youre-looking-WRONG-Africa-China-Mexico-distorted-despite-access-accurate-satellite-data.html\n\nAfrica could for sure host all the blacks from the world, and with great comfort. This is where we should aim, instead of praising this multiculturalist bullshit. \n\n It is true that social condition play a role in crime. However, if you compare societies with and without multiculturalism, you can only conclude that regarding societies who are at the same level of development,  crime is lower in non multiculturalists societies. For example, the crime rate in Japan is far lower than it is in the US. \n\nJust one question before i'm leaving this topic: do you guys realize that you are less and less in numbers, and that SJWs are less and less popular around the world? Your primary concern as SJWs was to be loved, to be considered as somewhat superior because you are tolerant. In a way, a SJW tries to get higher in the human hierarchy, not by being a leader, someone intelligent or charismatic, but only by being the most \"tolerant\". Well, it is failing. You are less and less considered as cool people. I see it both IRL and on the internet. \n\nYou are becoming a joke even for non whites... \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM-HJT8_esM\n\nAnd blacks don't like you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_WinXlct9s\n\nNobody respects people who don't respect themselves.

The less a particular western population is in contact with diversity, the more SJWs they are. This phenomenom is directly linked to one thing SJWs don't have a grasp on: reality. It seems this Australian guy have no clue about the joy of living day to day with our blessed diversity in western Europa or in the US. I suggest he take a prolonged vacation in Detroit, USA, Saint Denis, France, or Marseilles. But he won't do such thing. He prefers to stay in wonderland.  The only way for a SJW to wake up, is to be molested by our diversity. Since most SJWs live in nice areas with mostly whites from upper social categories, they can live a full live without having a problem. Until the whole west will be mixed up with non caucasian. By then it will be too late, and ethnic tensions will be everywhere. \n\nAlso, it's pretty pretentious for him to say that Australia could host the whole world population. What does he mean by this? That Africans can't take care of themselves by living in Africa? That is the problem of SJWs, as it is say in the previous link i posted (blacks saying they don't like SJWs). \n\nFor SJWs, Africans should be taken care of, like children, and hosted in our western countries, because they can't manage to live happily in Africa. \n\nI say, let's discuss about remigration, and even help non caucasians to go back in the land of their ancestors. They'll be more than happy to be able to live in Africa with decent living conditions. \n\nIn a way, SJWs are the more racists. Since for them the west should host non caucasians because they can't take care of themselves. \n\nI say, let's let everybody live were they are supposed to live.\n\n\nAlso, i wanted to add that SJWs are beings that are not complete. They have a hole inside of them. Indeed, if one need others in their lives in order to feel complete, happy, then they are not confident human beings.\n\nSJWs NEED diversity, because without it, they would feel empty.

[...]\n\nInteresting topic. I'm also thinking here and there about the future of relationships between men and women. I am a red pill guy. Did you know that paternity fraud is about 30% in the homo sapiens species? And i don't mean in Africa, or in some poor favelas, but EVERYWHERE? Yes, don't want to cast a cloud, but you might have a sibling who isn't your fathers, and you most probably have friends who's father don't share DNA with them. I personnaly have doubts about some of my cousins. As for my own father, if some of you are curious, we share a typical physical feature. So... not 100% sure, but pretty sure. I could DNA test him, it's not the price, but i don't see me coming at him: \"let me take saliva inside of your mouth with a cotton swab, or 3 clean pieces of you nails, or a nice amount of hair\".\n\nMore topic related, the big problem is, for the first time in all history, even for the first time since the begining of homo sapiens, women don't need men at all in order to reproduce. \n\nNo wonder why they don't want marriage anymore. \n\n\n1/Your idea probably won't work. \n\nParetto law. Women would fuck the best 20% of men constantly (well you might say in the west most women already do this ;-)), and men in the lowest 80% would get some maybe one every few years, if any. So they will mostly have sex with their hands and porn. \n\n\nMen won't accept to be in a relationship in those conditions. Even to raise children. What's more, women would crave to get impregnated by the alpha she's banging, and not the man she agreed to raise her first child with. So paternity fraud problem again, and it won't be possible in the future, since you can now order a DNA test on amazon for less than 100 dollars. \n\nAlso, when a women don't like her man anymore, she mostly don't want to stay with him, even if it's only for raising children. She wants to leave and be with her new alpha.  That alone defeats the whole idea.\n\n2/Polygamy, but with easy divorce possible, might be better.  Not like the one in arab muslims country, were divorce is not possible, and were the man must be rich in order to have more than one wife, but rich doesn't necessarily mean being attractive if you are fat or old.\n\nSo you would have an \"alpha\", typically a rich, buffed, tall men in his 30-40, who would have a few women, and 80% of men who would have sex with robots.\n\nBut you are right, polygamy won't happen. Not because of morals, but because the state will have less and less influence in the lives of people in the future. \n\n\n3/So best thing would be as individuals to fuck whoever  you want, and if a child is born, take your responsability and help to raise him, and provide for him even if you are not living with the mother. Of course DNA test him before ;-)\n\n\n4/Anyway, when we will enter the post capitalist era i.e an era without private property of the means of production, due to the tendency of the rate of profit to fall,  the hierarchy between the men will be more equal. There would still be buffed, charismatic, intelligent and beautiful men who would get most pussy, but something as a billionaire or even a millionaire getting illimited pussy, and hobos getting absolutely none, will most likely not exist anymore. \n\nIn a \"superior communist\" society, women will likely get pregnant by the men of their choice, and society as a whole will raise the kid with the women and her family (uncles, aunts, grandmothers and the mother would raise the child). Kids would probably know their father, but he won't contribute to his education. That is what happened, and still happen in primordial tribes (primordial communism), where their is an abundance of natural ressources i.e the tropics. Women get impregnated by the most attractive men, and men don't raise their own children. They raise their nephew though, so their genes are still passed on in a way if they are not attractive, since they have close DNA to their sisters.\n\nSuperior communism will be the reflect of primordial communism, with technology.",

I think the greatest communist was probably Stalin in that he actually implemented socialism properly and stamped out markets. His social policy was what some would label as conservative. Men and Women were expected to have children and if they didn't, between around 20-50 (it was different for men and women because biology), they were levied with more taxes. This incentivised them to have more kids, a yes the state did help with the child rearing so that the mother could work which I think is good.\n\n\nStalin is not at all my vision of communism. My vision is about Paris, Barcelona (1937) and Budapest (1956) communes.\n\nSuperior communism is not about taxes, but a Stateless, moneyless, hierarchyless mode of production. Bolshevism was state capitalism. \n\nFor those who don't have a clue, it's an idea close to P2P or open source in it's essence. ",
