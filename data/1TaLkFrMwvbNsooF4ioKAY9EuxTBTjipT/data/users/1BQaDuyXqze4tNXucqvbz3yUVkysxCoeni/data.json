It's assholes like you that are pushing every day moderate people further & further right with garbage slandering comments. Keep accusing people of being racist and they'll stop caring about being called racists.\n\nPlease keep it up, those of us on the right can use more people getting pissed off and out to the polls again.",

But as long as I still have a choice I'm ok with it. I'm also ok with some ads, especially if I get a cut of the revenue.\n\nI just started using AdNauseam in Vivaldi, I have ÂµBlock Origins installed in Edge, and I use Brave's internal blockers when using that.\n\nIt seems that Brave Mobile is the best mobile browser right now as long as you don't need some weird extension.",

Export your Chrome bookmarks than purge that as well. Delete Facebook especially all the Facebook apps. What's App is also owned by Facebook.\n\nIf you must set up a LinkedIn profile for work. \n\nhttps://darkshroud24.wordpress.com/2017/07/16/alternatives-to-google-facebook-and-reclaiming-privacy/",

That way all your emails are kept encrypted on the server. This is not ideal, but better than nothing.\n\nI use Outlook with https://www.gpg4win.org/ for PGP email signing and encrypting on my system.\n\nFor Thunderbird also check out TorBirdy: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy",
