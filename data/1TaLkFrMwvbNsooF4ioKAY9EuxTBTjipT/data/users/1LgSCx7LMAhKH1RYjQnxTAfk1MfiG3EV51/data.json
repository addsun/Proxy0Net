[...]\n\nIncome tax did not exist for some time in America.  The united states federal government received its income through other methods, one of which was tariffs, which help industry on our soil.  I believe government is a necessary evil, we should keep it limited.  Obviously government cannot exist without taxation, and life without government would be terrible, because human beings aren't perfectly moral.  I think we should keep government limited.",
