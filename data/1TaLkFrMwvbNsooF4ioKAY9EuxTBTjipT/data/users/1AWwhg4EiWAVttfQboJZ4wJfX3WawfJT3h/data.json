			"title": "ZeroMe Feed Bot",
			"body": "This is a python script that will turn a ZeroMe Profile into a RSS feed reader.\n\n> RSS (Rich Site Summary; originally RDF Site Summary; often called Really Simple Syndication) uses a family of standard web feed formats to publish frequently updated information: blog entries, news headlines, audio, video. An RSS document (called \"feed\", \"web feed\", or \"channel\") includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author's name. [Src:Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)\n\n[How to Subscribe to RSS Feeds](http://rss-tutorial.com/rss-how-to-subscribe-to-feeds.htm)\n\n## How to Install:\n\n1.  Backup your `/path/to/zeronet/data/users.json`, delete it and restart ZeroNet. Create a new ID (ZeroID, [KaffieID](/id.kaffie.bit/), etc).\n    Clone a hub (**Don't mess up existing hub, newcomers will be disappointed when they find only Robots and Zombies in the public timeline. Also you can control your post storage limit with your own hub, or suffer this `content.json: Include too large 277327 > 50000 ... Sign failed: Invalid content` XD**), then login ZeroMe with your new ID and your hub.\n\n2.  Create a folder named `FeedBot` under your ZeroNet root directory:\n    `$ cd /path/to/zeronet && mkdir FeedBot`\n    Download [the script file ↗](https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/Userscripts/raw/master/FeedBot/feedbot.py) or [copy it from Nullpaste](/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/?user_binchan2@zeroid.bit) to the folder, also under `FeedBot` folder create an empty file named with `rssAddresses.txt`.\n\n    PS: One-line command : `$ cd /path/to/zeronet && mkdir FeedBot && cd FeedBot && touch rssAddresses.txt && wget https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/Userscripts/raw/master/FeedBot/feedbot.py`\n\n3.  Add your feeds:\n    There are two way to add your feeds:\n    One way is to directly copy your feed url to `rssAddresses.txt`, one url one line.\n    The other way is to create post with your bot ZeroMe account. The format is `add-feed YOUR_FEED_URL`. Your can also delete your feed with `del-feed URL`. That's cool, isn't it ;) You can also use your major ZeroMe account to add and delete feed url. Check the code to add the feature by yourself :P\n\n4.  Backup `/path/to/zeronet/data/users.json` (You need to copy your bot site address, id auth address and auth key later when first time running the script), restore your major `users.json` and restart ZeroNet.\n\n5.  Run the script:\n    Install package dependency `feedparser`: `$ pip install feedparser` or with other method. Then simply run it with `$ python feedbot.py`. If you want to run it periodically, you can use `$ watch -n TIME_INTERVAL_IN_SECOND -x python feedbot.py`. The script normally won't fetch anything if there are no new content. But some websites don't support `etag` and `last-modified header`, the script has to always fetch feeds from them, but still won't update anything.\n    PS: On my Raspberry pi 2 `watch` doesn't work together with `tmux`, so I use this one instead: `$ while sleep TIME_INTERVAL_IN_SECOND; do python feedbot.py; done`.\n\n## Screenshot:\n\n[Screenshot](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/merged-ZeroMe/1oranGeS2xsKZ4jVsu9SVttzgkYXu4k9v/data/users/1AWwhg4EiWAVttfQboJZ4wJfX3WawfJT3h/1492140736.jpg)\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-04-14_09-42-10.png (24x24)](data/img/post_22_Bildschirmfoto_2017-04-14_09-42-10.png)\n\n## Bugs and Troubleshooting:\n\n### 1\\. The script sometimes hangs up.\n\nOfficial `feedparser` package [doesn't support timeout setting](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/pull/80), so you need to install it from another branch. How to:\n\n1.  Uninstall the package if you've installed it: `$ pip uninstall feedparser`.\n2.  Clone the branch with timeout function and install it (Default is 30 seconds, check [this](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/pull/80)): `$ git clone https://github.com/JPFrancoia/feedparser && cd feedparser && python setup.py install --user`\n\nNote: There is another solution by using `requests` library instead [[1]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9772691/feedparser-with-timeout) [[2]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27621689/not-getting-a-304-response-even-after-adding-etag-header), I will check it later^TM if I have time.\n\n\n## Todo:\n\n*   ~~Also add Feed Summary (300-500 character limit).~~\n*   Keyword filters especially for large websites.\n*   Remove posts with keyword\n*   Set limit of post size\n*   Any recommendation?\n\n## License:\n\nMIT",

			"title": "ZeroMe Mastodon Bridge",
			"body": "Another python script :3 This script gives you the power to cross post between ZeroMe and Mastodon, which means when you post something on ZeroMe, it will also post to your Mastodon account, and vice versa.\n\nWhat is Mastodon? It's a Twitter-like, that based on OStatus protocol, distributed social network, and recently its user base and development are exploding. For more information check [its github repository](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/).\n\n## Screenshot:\n\n[Screenshot](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/merged-ZeroMe/1oranGeS2xsKZ4jVsu9SVttzgkYXu4k9v/data/users/1AWwhg4EiWAVttfQboJZ4wJfX3WawfJT3h/1493424295.jpg)\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-04-28_23-03-49.png (24x24)](data/img/post_23_Bildschirmfoto_2017-04-28_23-03-49.png)\n\n## How to Install - ZeroMe Mastodon Bridge:\n\nUnlike Feedbot.py, this time the installation is quite simple. First you need to have an account from [a Mastodon instance](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-Mastodon/List-of-Mastodon-instances.md). Then create a folder named `ZeroMeMastodonBridge` under your ZeroNet root directory (Or simply use the FeedBot folder if you have created one):\n`$ cd /path/to/zeronet && mkdir ZeroMeMastodonBridge`\nDownload [the script file ↗](https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/Userscripts/raw/master/ZeroMeMastodonBridge/zerome_mastodon_bridge.py) or [copy it from Nullpaste](/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/?user_binchan2@zeroid.bit) to the folder, then install dependent packages `html2text` and `Mastodon.py` like with `$ pip install html2text --user && pip install Mastodon.py --user`. That's all.\n\nRun the script with `$ python zerome_mastodon_bridge.py`, just at the first time it will ask you to input your hub `address`, ID `auth_address`, ID `auth_privatekey` (you can find them in the `users.json`) and your Mastodon instance website address, your username and password of your Mastodon account.\n\nYou can keep repeating the script with `$ while sleep TIME_INTERVAL_IN_SECOND; do python zerome_mastodon_bridge.py; done`.\n\nPS: The script also supports to set last timestamps without cross-posting anything, with command: `$ cd /path/to/zeronet/ZeroMeMastodonBridge && python -c 'from zeronet_mastodon_bridge import initGlobalName, setLastTimestamp; initGlobalName(); setLastTimestamp()'`\n\n## How to Install - ZeroMe Gnusocial Bridge:\n\nThe process is similar to \"ZeroMe Mastodon Bridge\", but in addition you need to create an\naccess token dict: First register an OAuth client applicant from Settings -> Connections, then check [https://pythonhosted.org/gnusocial/oauth.html](https://pythonhosted.org/gnusocial/oauth.html) to get the access_token dict. Finally copy & paste the dict when running the script at the first time. [Script file ↗](https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/Userscripts/raw/master/ZeroMeMastodonBridge/zerome_gnusocial_bridge.py)\n\nFor Markdown support, add [this](https://git.gnu.io/chimo/markdown), and enable it in Settings.\n\n## Bugs and Troubleshooting:\n\n1.  Currently Mastodon doesn't support markdown, so your post from ZeroMe to Mastodon won't be well formatted. But in contrast post from Mastodon to ZeroMe will be formatted, thanks to `html2text`, though it may still have some bugs. Also Mastodon limits post to 500 characters by default.\n\n## Todo^TM:\n\n*   Image support is possible ...\n*   ZeroMe API\n\n## License:\n\nMIT\n\n## A Small Proposal:\n\nCurrently ZeroMe still has not many users (though I also like small community), and most hubs have quite heavy limit to content size. But I believe ZeroMe is still quite a promising project . Besides keep improving performance and adding functions, similiar to using same protocol like traditional email service, Diaspora* with Friendica (Friendica also supports connecting to many other websites, before it could also hack Facebook, but later Facebook built some high wall...) and Hubzilla, Mastodon with StatusNet, Gnusocial and Quitter. In the long term it may be better that ZeroMe and ZeroNet can communicate with other distributed (social) network, or just P2P (social) network. Therefore ZeroMe and ZeroNet project won't become an isolated island.",

			"title": "Language Sorting for ZeroTalk",
			"body": "For topic [here](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1BLueGvui1GdbtsjcKqCf4F67uKfritG49/1PniNzyi8fygvwyBaLpA9oBDVWZ5fXuJUw/1495610689) and [here](/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:2_1PniNzyi8fygvwyBaLpA9oBDVWZ5fXuJUw/Dear+Chinese+friends), guess it may be nice to have a language sorting function for ZeroTalk.\n\nI prefer to leave the main forum multi-lingual, then setup sub-forum for different language. So the language sorting function will be like:\n\n1.  Article posted in sub-forum will be tagged with that language (also it will be displayed in the main forum).\n2.  User who posts article in main forum will be suggested to add a language tag or choose it from list.\n3.  User who doesn't add a language tag will be auto-sorted with script.\n4.  Limit Unicode Range usage in sub-forum, to prevent user from posting with other language.*\n\nFrom [Wikipedia: UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)\nThe UTF-8 code catagory for different language is basically like:\n\n| Size | Unicode Range | Character Name | Relative Languages or States |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1-byte | U+0000..U+007F | ASCII (Hindu–Arabic numerals, Latin...) | English |\n| 2-byte | U+0080..U+00FF | Latin-1 | Major: French, German, Spanish, Icelandic, Vietnamese |\n| ... | U+0100..U+036F | *Latin Extended, etc. | ... |\n| ... | U+0370..U+03FF | Greek and Coptic | Greek |\n| ... | U+0400..U+04FF | Cyrillic | Major: Russian, Belorussian, Bulgarian, Abkhasian, Serbian |\n| ... | U+0500..U+052F | *Cyrillic Supplement | ... |\n| ... | U+0530..U+058F | *Armenian | Armenian |\n| ... | U+0590..U+05FF | Hebrew | Hebrew |\n| ... | U+0600..U+06FF | Arabic | Arabic |\n| ... | U+0700..U+074F | *Syriac | ... |\n| ... | U+0750..U+077F | *Arabic Supplement | Pakistan, Africa, old Persian, etc |\n| ... | U+0780..U+07BF | *Thaana | Maldives |\n| ... | U+07C0..U+07FF | *NKo | West Africa |\n| 3-byte | U+0800..U+3040 | *Indic, Latin Extended, etc. | ... |\n| ... | U+3041..U+30FF | Kana | Japanese, Okinawan, Ainu, Palauan |\n| ... | U+3100..U+4DFF | *Hangul Compatibility Jamo, Enclosed CJK Letters and Months, etc. | ... |\n| ... | U+4E00..U+9FFF | CJK Unified Ideographs | China, Hong Kong, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam |\n| ... | U+A000..U+ABFF | *Asian, Hangul Jamo Extended, etc. | ... |\n| ... | U+AC00..U+D7AF | Hangul Syllables | Korean |\n| ... | U+D7B0..U+FFFF | *Hangul Jamo Extended, Private Use Area, etc. | ... |\n| 4-byte | U+10000..U+10FFFF | *Emoji, Smiley, Language from other planet, etc. | ... |\n\nSo the script will be like:\n\n```\nif (the_text.match(/[\\u0370-\\u03FF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Greek');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\u0400-\\u04FF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Cyrillic');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\u0590-\\u05FF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Hebrew');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\u0600-\\u06FF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Arabic');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\u3041-\\u30FF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Kana');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\uAC00-\\uD7AF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s Hangul');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else if (the_text.match(/[\\u4E00-\\u9FFF]/) {\n  console.log('It\\'s CJK Unified Ideographs');\n  // Sort it to...\n} else {\n  console.log('It\\'s likely latin.');\n  // Sort it to...\n}\n```\n\nPS: Python has a library named [langid](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py) that can be used to detect many languages.

Also you should bind your ip to your devices in the router config panel. [[ref - Is it possible to install ZeroNet to a remote machine?]](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/)\n\n    Also with a terminal app like [ConnectBot](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.connectbot/) or [Termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/), you can use [the method](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/1GnJD7CXskmG8GywMbTvbP12wneCFW9XzR/1483533203) mentioned by weakish:\n    > Alternatively, you can just start ZeroNet on remote machine as normal, without --ui_ip, UiPassword, reverse proxy, SSL, etc.\n    > And run this command at local machine:\n    > `ssh -L 43110:127.0.0.1:43110 -N username@remote`\n    > Then you can just access [http://127.0.0.1:43110/](http://127.0.0.1:43110/) on your local machine, securely.\n\n*   Access by [ZeroNet-kivy](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-kivy), it's also available on [Google Play - ZeroNet4Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mkg20001.zeronet)\n  **[Alert]**: Currently ZeroNet-kivy stores sensitive data like your users.json as well as your private keys in the internal storge, which can be read by any other apps that have \"internel storage\" permission. So only use it for testing.\n\n*   Access by [Termux Android](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/), here is [a script](https://github.com/PeterCxy/Termux-ZeroNet) to automate everything. `greenlet` clang patch has been merged to main stream, so you can change it to `pip2 install greenlet` in the script.\n\n*   Access by [SSH tunnel](https://lignux.com/zeronet-en-android/) (Spanish)\n\n*   Access by clearnet proxy [[List of working proxies]](/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:proxies)\n    Note: if the list is blank or looks incomplete, check `History` for a complete version.\n\n## Mobile Improvement for Zites:\n\n*   ZeroHello, ZeroMe and ZeroTalk are already mobile friendly.\n\n*   ZeroBlog:\n    * [Updated ZeroBlog with Tag Index and Mobile Support](/15mSYzsDxzarssqtV1pFPKqoCTaLdjVB2f/)\n    * [Minimal and Beautiful ZeroBlog Themed by ZAlex](/1A5nKj7XV3SqU9CdAtpnYu7eqiaSHKcj9X/)\n    * [Poster](/1J2ZJjs97wEcW36x5d9f1QnPVPVDv8wbJ/)\n        A simple blog platform for ZeroNet written from scratch using Vue.js and Bulma.\n\n*   ZeroMail: [[ZeroMail Mobile Simple Solution]](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:40)\n    For ZeroMail, the userstyle file is also provided [here](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-mobile.userstyle.css). If you prefer dark theme, check [A Dark Theme for ZeroNet](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:3), the mobile improvement is included.\n\n*   Note 1: Besides installing the css code with Stylish, you can directly add it to ZeroMail, create a file named all2.css in `/path/to/zite/css/`, copy the css code (except the first line which starts with `@-moz-document` and the last `}`) to it, then copy `/path/to/zite/index.html` to `/path/to/zite/index2.html`, inside index2.html, change the code\n\n    ```\n    ...\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/all.css\" />\n    ...\n    ```\n\n    to\n\n    ```\n    ...\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/all.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/all2.css\" />\n    ...\n    ```\n\n    Then visit your zite and add index2.html at the end of the address. Like `http:/127.0.0.1:43110/Mail.ZeroNetwork.bit//index2.html` for ZeroMail, same with ZeroSites, ZeroBoard, etc.\n\n## Browser Recommendation (Android):\n\n*   [Lightning Browser](https://f-droid.org/packages/acr.browser.lightning/) (recommended by Musickiller): brings really fast experience. Also ZeroChat doesn't work in this browser (Probably because it doesn't support JavaScript class, which was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)).\n    For privacy concern, you may like to change startpage and default search engine to Duckduckgo or Searx (the query url format is [https://instance.url/?q=](https://instance.url/?q=), I also add `!go !ddg !wp !wd` because Bing and Yahoo suck).\n\n*   [Orfox from Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/apps/): Torbrowser for Android, so you can use it to block all harmful clearnet connections, but ZeroMe image upload doesn't work with this browser.\n    You need to also install Orbot (Tor android) or Orfox will complain it when starting. After install it, enter `about:config` and search for `no_proxy`, add your remote machine ip and/or localhost like: `192.168.1.xxx:43110, 127.0.0.1:43110`. If you want the Stylish add-on, you can also add the related add-on download address. I use the adb method instead: `adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -c android.intent.category.DEFAULT -d file:///mnt/sdcard/Download/ -n info.guardianproject.orfox/.App` [[ref]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36049137/installing-unsigned-xpis-in-firefox-for-android-version-42-or-newer)\n\n*   [Icecat Mobile](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gnu.icecat/): 100% freesoftware. For me this one is with the best compatibility. ~~But also the most laggy one...~~ Icecat 52.3 is quite smooth, recommended.\n\n*   Note2: If the font size is too big or too small, you can change it in Settings.\n\n*   Note3: Some zites may support mobile mode but the owner didn't add viewport setting to it, in this case, you can contact the owner to add `\"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\",` in her/his content.json [[ref]](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/content_json/), or force viewport in your browser: for Lightning Browser, uncheck `Use wide viewport` in Settings -> Display Settings. For Orfox or Icecat Mobile, search `viewport` in `about:config`, then change `browser.viewport.desktopWidth` to a smaller value, for me is 400.\n\n## Issues and Troubleshootings:\n\n*   In some browser the \"0\" button is not clickable or need to tap twice, so use bookmark to access ZeroHello instead. Also the config panel is not very reactive, so you can try to refresh the screen (like for \"This is my site\" switcher) or tap the button more than one time to make it work.\n*   [Fixed] On ZeroMe Mobile many image previews are blank. Weird bug, but you can still touch the screen twice to get the fullsize image.\n\n## Credits:\n\n*   Thank Nofish and other ZeroNet devs for this awesome project!\n\n*   Thank Mkg20001 for the ZeroNet-kivy app!\n\n*   Also thank every active ZeroNet fellows :3\n\n## Edit:\n-\n[171117] Polish section - Mobile Improvement for Zites\n[291017] Add alert for ZeroNet-kivy Android app. Thank shouko for sharing it.\n[030817] Remove \"Independent Scroll for Panels in ZeroHello\".\n[010817] Add `ZeroHello Mobile`, `Minimal and Beautiful ZeroBlog Themed by ZAlex` to Mobile Improvement for Zites.

			"title": "A Universal ZeroNet Dark Theme - Re-Edition :3",
			"body": "> White theme is for noob, light theme is for amateur, dark theme is for expert ;)\n\nThis userstyle has been actively polished for more than 10 months, should work on all official zites and their clones.\nSome unofficial zites are also supported, like NullPaste, ZeroWiki, Kaffiene Search. Nevertheless, some other zites may have side effects - that some bright elements are still not changed. You can try it yourself, ask me to modify them or temporarily disable the theme.\n\nSome devs may find the way I develop this userstyle very stupid, I should be able to automate a lot of things by writing a python script, but I enjoy the procedure like playing jigsaw puzzles, and having some simple time X)\n\nCode theme is Vim Desert.\n\nFor Firefox family browser before Firefox 57, you can install it by [Stylish](https://github.com/stylish-userstyles/stylish) plugin/add-on.\nFor Chrome family browser, you can use [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus). The Chrome version of Stylish and the Firefox version newer than 3.xx is not recommended, as it's not opensource and has [an opt-out option to collect user data](https://malwaretips.com/threads/stylish-browser-add-on-2-million-users-impacted-by-new-data-collection-policy.67191/), and I confirm that even I uncheck the data collection option, every time I start Inox (an ungoogled Chromium) it will connect to google-analytics. Even so use a firefox family browser if you care your privacy.\n\nCurrently Stylus Beta is available for Firefox 57, but in my version ([Iceweasel](https://wiki.parabola.nu/Iceweasel), Debian's rebranded version from Firefox), it doesn't work for ZeroNet. There is another add-on called [xStyle](https://github.com/FirefoxBar/xStyle) but it doesn't work, too... So currently there is no solution for Firefox 57.\n\n## How to install:\n\nIf you use Firefox (version < 57) and Stylish 2.xx, in the `Manage Styles` Setting you can choose `Install from URLs`, then simply copy [this link](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.css) and install it (for NullPaste bin it doesn't work in this way).\n\nIf you use Stylus, under `Manage` page, use `Import styles` and import [this file](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme-for-import.json), then click the update button to update it to the lastet version. You can also set up auto-update interval under `Options UI`.\n\nIf you use remote server mode or clearnet proxy and your ZeroNet address is not `127.0.0.1:43110`, you need to change the addresses below in the json file.\n\n```\n...\n    \"updateUrl\": \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.json\",\n    \"md5Url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.md5\",\n    \"url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/?Post:3:A+Dark+Theme+For+ZeroNet\",\n...\n```\nIn another way you can create a new theme and choose import Mozilla Format from the left panel, then copy & paste the content of [this link](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/shared/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.css), but you need to manually repeat these steps for update.\n\n## Screenshot:\nFrom [my Jekyll Zite](/1ADGCZCvC6wCf5GwCY23H9uwKyRiixoLt6/photos/dark_theme/)\n\n## Other sources:\n\n[My repo](/13zzNGxEXDeLxHEGZdG3mE7G8dChf45LrV) on Git Center. You can track the update log, submit issue and make request there.\n[repository on git.gnu.io](https://git.gnu.io/chbinnc/Userscripts/raw/master/Userstyles/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.css)\n[my gallery](/1ADGCZCvC6wCf5GwCY23H9uwKyRiixoLt6/zeronet-dark-theme.userstyle.css) (Unmaintained, too lazy to update it :3)\n[my NullPaste bin](/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/?user_binchan2@zeroid.bit) (Unmaintained, too lazy to update it :3)\n[userstyle.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/136470/zeronet-dark-theme) (Unmaintained, easy to install but the website contains many third-party javascripts)\n\nHope you enjoy it :)",
