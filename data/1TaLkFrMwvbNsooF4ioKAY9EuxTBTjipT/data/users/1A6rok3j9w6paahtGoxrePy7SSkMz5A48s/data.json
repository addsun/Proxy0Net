It is impossible to tell what the value will be in the future, and there may be some event that causes it to crash at any moment, for instance if a major exchange is hacked, a flaw in the system is found, or if a new technology is created which makes Bitcoin obsolete, etc.\n\nYes. There is no \"normal.\" I'd use average. $2k is still note worthy given where it was in 2015. Which means the new average could fall within $1k.",
