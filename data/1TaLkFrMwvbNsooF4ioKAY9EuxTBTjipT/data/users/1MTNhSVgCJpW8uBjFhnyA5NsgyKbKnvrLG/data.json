			"body": "I've been on and off the net since around 1993. Most recently I have been putting my energies into Tor hidden services. Now, I am looking at Zeronet, which is fun to be honest. Love it. All these different technologies to investigate. Then, I accidentally into OpenDNS and the world of alternative TLDs. Oh my.\n\nMy mind is blown. Again.\n\nThis happened when i first got wind of Linux and switched from Windows 98. Take the top off computing and it's huge! I mean, the internet is turtles all the way down. I knew this already in some sense.  It's just crazy having that realisation a second time. Wander off the well worn clearnet path just a little and the trails and forests of the internets (I know.... \"internet\") go all over the place. \n\nI don't want this to sound all \"eternal september\" with a user being faced with the world outside AOL. but woah dude! The opportunities are incredible. Perhaps I am alone in this silliness? Or not. \n\n/random-thought\n\nApologies!",
