			"title": "CIA's Bin Laden Files - Open Directory & Torrents [300GB]",
			"body": "Hey all,\n\nAs some of you may know, the CIA recently released the contents of Osama bin Laden's hard drive.\nI have created torrents of two sets of files. The first is the full underacted 300GB release located at archive.org.\n\nThe second was the cleaned up version the CIA re-released later that comes to 250GB. You can see at cia.gov a glossary of what files were removed and changed. This 250GB archive has had a lot of the copyrighted material removed, and all office docs converted to PDF.\n\n---\n\nTorrents:\n\n300GB Unsorted release - Magnet:\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:5970e1db8207a40603a8ef70188202ef57a3d37e&dn=Everything.20171021.zip\n\n250GB Sorted release - Magnet:\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:ed069768afad9f3a4650345104c7ce4c5d764e4d&dn=BinLaden_CIA.zip\n\n---\n\nOpen Directory: https://the-eye.eu/public/ladens_trove/\n\nYou may also use our Fusker tool to view images on directories all at once. https://fusker.the-eye.eu/\nExample Fusker url: https://fusker.the-eye.eu/url.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-eye.eu%2Fpublic%2Fladens_trove%2F000201032%2F\n\n---\n\nWant to know more about our project?
