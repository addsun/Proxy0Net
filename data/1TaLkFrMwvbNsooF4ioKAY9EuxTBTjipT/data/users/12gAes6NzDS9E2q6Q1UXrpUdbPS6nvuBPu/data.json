Punctuation includes: . , ! ? ( ) [ ] { }\n* You can now add images while editing a story\n\n### Bug Fixes\n* Empty responses and stories are *kinda* disallowed (There is still a bug that I'm unsure how to fix)\n* The \"publish\" button is temporarily disabled after clicking it when publishing a response. This prevents people from accidentally clicking it twice, which will post the response twice.\n* Images that are uploaded will have the date uploaded appended to the filename. This ensures that there are no collisions with image names.\n* For images that are uploaded with non-ascii characters in the filename, the non-ascii characters are removed - this is to prevent a ZeroNet bug with non-latin characters. Spaces are also replaced by underscores and quotes (double and single) are removed.\n* The registration will not continue until you select a primary language and enter a username.\n* When posting edited story, if title is same as before, no need to add date to end of it\n* When interests is empty and you click to follow an interest, do not start the interests string with a comma ','. This prevents there from being an empty interest\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroMedium.bit",

They just want to shut down what they think is offensive like calling trannies \"he\" instead of \"she\" or \"xir\", this happened recently with the node.js project. [...]\n\nI just read the article you linked. I do agree that you shouldn't have to think about diversity, you should just have to think about who are good programmers, etc. If they end up being diverse, then so be it - but it isn't necessarily racists when there's a person of color or different sexual orientation that you didn't think did a good job with the code, etc. However, I'm not sure that there are or aren't biased people who hire certain people as programmers over others because of their biases. It'd be something that I'd have to research further.\n\nI've also never heard of anything like what was detailed in the article (with the github message about not accepting pull requests from people of color). I just can't believe that that has actually happened. It's sad that people just automatically jump to conclusions with no substantial proof, just imagining a pattern from something they observed. And the thing is, these patterns that people assume out of observations are often wrong - This is precisely why Scientists don't just look at patterns. They conduct multiple experiments and modify hypotheses and theories until they know for sure. I think many people need to work on this more.",

Can you share a reference?  I'm particularly curious about things like: [...]\n\nAccording to the study described, Esperanto helps you learn many languages faster. Why, because you already learned one language: Esperanto. It is very well know that learning a third language is faster than learning the second because you have already learned a language before (the second). This, in fact, extends to many other things besides languages.\n\nNext, Esperanto borrows *many* words from European and slavic, languages as well as Greek and Latin, meaning words are very similar (libro in Esperanto is book, libro in Spanish is book). You can then more easily learn these words in Esperanto if the language in which the word was borrowed from is your native language, or a language you learned previously. These are called *cognates*. Esperanto has many with many other languages, including English (). Again, very well know as this exists in other languages, but I would say less so in languages that come from different language families (English as an exception because a lot of Latin came into English around the time of Middle English, and then again after that - I haven't read on this for a while, so I may be wrong about the *times* that latin came into English).\n\nEsperanto has a pretty consistent grammar. This means there are less exceptions, decreasing the time you must take to learn these exceptions, and the ease in which you can learn and remember the grammar of the language. Languages, including Esperanto, that have pretty consistens grammars take less time to learn and are generally (at least slightly) easier to learn because of less exceptions and \"weirdness\" within the language.\n\nWhat I was mainly saying was that the amount of speakers isn't a limiting factor because even the amount of Esperanto speakers is enough to be able to read a lot of material and speak to a lot of people. You aren't going to speak to more than 10 million people in your lifetime. Same goes to literature but less so, of course (also dependent on how much you read).\n\nLearning Esperanto is also useful for people who want to study constructed languages, their cultures, their people, beliefs. It's also might be useful for Linguists and conlangers (me being one myself).\n\nLanguages have many cognitive benefits, yes. Not necessarily with the vocab. They strengthen your brain. They allow you to more easily learn another language. They allow you to learn how to learn a language more effectively, which will improve how you learn your third language. They let you become more exposed to a more variety of cultures, ideas, etc. It improves memory, your native-language skills, etc. It makes you more aware about the specifics of languages (grammar - all languages more or less have very similar things within them, there's also different types of languages, for example inflectional, isolating - each having similar things when looking at morphology and syntax - you should look more into linguistics if you're interested in languages).\n\nBut also, there are different Semantics and Pragmatics in different langauges. Different languages categorize or differentiate between things differently. In English there is here, there, and afar - they distinguish between distance (here is closer than there). But in other languages, there may be more words with more differences in distances. Look into Semantics and Pragmatics if you want.\n\nFor the study, there were many studies done: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto#Third-language_acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto#Third-language_acquisition). I know that people don't trust Wikipedia, but it does give sources. Here's an exerpt:\n\n> Studies have been conducted in New Zealand,[75] United States,[76][77][78] Germany,[79] Italy[80] and Australia.[81] The results of these studies were favorable and demonstrated that studying Esperanto before another foreign language expedites the acquisition of the other, natural language. This appears to be because learning subsequent foreign languages is easier than learning one's first foreign language, whereas the use of a grammatically simple and culturally flexible auxiliary language like Esperanto lessens the first-language learning hurdle. In one study,[82] a group of European secondary school students studied Esperanto for one year, then French for three years, and ended up with a significantly better command of French than a control group, who studied French for all four years.\n\nThis also talks about the study I just mentioned to you in the previous post, here's the reference: \n> Williams, N.

The number of people that speak it (and for how long it's been spoken) are pretty directly related to these goals.  Esperanto is a bad bet on both counts.  If you know of any actual data on why people learn the foreign languages they do, I'd be interested to read it. [...]\n\nNow for what I like about Esperanto:\n* Very easy to learn\n* Learn more in a week than in 1 year of Spanish (based on experience, I took 3 years of Spanish in school, but only after a few weeks a learning Esperanto, I could speak more than in Spanish after 1 year)\n* Less exceptions to remember (especially compared to all those root-changing rules in Spanish, ex: o->ue; dormir -> duermo)\n* Constructed\n* Interesting way it handles grammar in a simplified way\n* Its correlatives system\n* Takes words from many languages\n* and more that I don't want to take the time to write out\n\n> [heyjude](#comment_7_1Ka5KfU2RbHEMTkHPPjAuiYCPbbxAtcoSn): I already learned english, my mother tongue is french. SO why would I want to learn esperanto? If it's to learn more languages, I'll learn Lojban, not esperanto. All you're doing is shill a shitty language hoping people will give a shit about it.\n\nNotice how I said languages like Esperanto, I would put lojban somewhat close to Esperanto, even though it's probably much harder since the grammar is very different from natural languages. But for its vocab, it is much better than Esperanto since I believe it takes words from more languages. Btw, I very much like lojban also.\n\nThe reason to learn Esperanto over Lojban - its probably easier because of the more naturalistic grammar.\nHowever, a reason to learn Esperanto over languages very similar to it (Ido, etc.), *none*.\n\nAlso remember, I didn't say before that you should learn Esperanto before natural languages, I was saying you should learn *Esperanto-like* languages first - **but only if your interested in it**.",

Unfortunately I haven't been able to find a copy of the studies linked in the Wikipedia article, so I don't have a firm opinion on the claims of accelerated learning yet and am not convinced.  But the fact that you've brought it up convinces me it might be the case. [...]\n\nAccording to the study, it *does* get you faster. People who spend 1 year with esperanto then 3 with french knew more than people with 4 years of french. This also means that you would have learned what the people with 4 years of french learned in less than 3 years. That's mathematics - simple. This also means you can explore the literature sooner since you would be knowing more sooner.\n\nI started learning Esperanto *before* Spanish. I could read and speak *way* more in Esperanto than in Spanish. In spanish, you don't even learn past verbs till 2nd year. Esperanto, you can learn them very quickly within a few weeks.\n\nYou don't think that a grammar that has consistent endings like what esperanto has (o for noun, a for adjective, etc.) is easier than trying to learn all the different conjugates of other languages, especially Spanish and Latin? Esperanto verbs don't conjugate based on person or number, but Spanish ones do, which means there are more endings for Spanish. You don't think that because of this Esperanto verbs would be easier to learn and remember?\n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure Esperanto takes from Latin and Greek too.",

You're not spending 4 years on Esperanto, only 1, then 3 on French.\n\nNow, technically neither of us have proved that it is/isn't worth it. I think it is, you don't. Let's just leave it at that.

They also load progressively, meaning they show a screen instantly, then load things when needed rather than trying to load it all at startup/pageload.\n\nInstant Apps, like I said before, are Android Apps. This means they don't use web technologies, they use Java and the Android Development Kit, etc. They are also contained in APKs, just like normal Android apps.

This allows google to download only the modules that are needed for the app to run in a *lightweight* mode before you need to install them. You then install them to get the full functionality.\n\nBiggest difference, PWAs use a browser and use web technologies and can be available for all platforms (Microsoft is working to get them into their store, Firefox is working on implementing them, I'm not sure what Apple is going to do with them), Instant Apps don't and are only for Android because they are Android Apps.",

Why? Because every step in this direction makes ZeroNet less and less mobile. I prefer having a super slim ZeroNet with only the necessary files, so I can use it basically everywhere without having to manage missing big files I store only at one computer, for example.Therefore I would suggest that any file sharing implementation is managed as separate as possible from the actual ZeroNet app. E.g. in this case I would totally recommend against putting anything like that into /data/user/ or any similar location. [...]\n\nWhy would you have to manage the missing big files? You don't need those big files on *every* device you use. If you want just necessary files, then don't use big files. It doesn't make it more complicated, it's literally the same as it was before big file support as long as you don't use the big files. \n\nAnd I also don't know why it would matter whether the big files are in your users directory if their optional.

The way it works is - users have the option to either view the proxy ad-free by donating a small amount of CPU resources for the purpose of mining Monero.. or they can disable the miner and instead enable the native ad-banners. Having a high-throttle (very low CPU usage) as well as a user consent notifications allows us to strike the right balance between monetization and quality of user experience. I'm actually gonna make a tutorial on this, so that anyone can do this with their own site. We need to make money, man.. enough with this starving artist bullshit. Stay tuned!\n\nI think I'll consider using bigcat.tk again. I just really don't like ads - they slow down machines, install malware, fake the user into clicking their ad because it looks like a download button, popup so I'm taken out of what I'm doing and have to click off the ad, and many ads don't let you close the window by doing alerts everytime you go to try to close it (thankfully browsers have fixed this by allowing you to prevent further alerts from a site).\n\nI think I will be fine with using my computer to mine, but you should be aware of computers that may have very low resources (I'm thinking like 5 year old computers, which I had to use a couple of months ago before I got a new computer with student loan money).\n\nAlso, you may want to check whether the user is using an ad blocker.",

ZeroMe asks for permission to read from ZeroMe hubs. KopyKate would also have to do this). As far as I know, I don't know if this is possible without merger zites.

The final release date for new versions will *not* change. What *will* change is when versions are released to [ZeroMedium BETA](/15HdD8ZwMLjzQhbDQcF8oRtkbxYxVS7JgU/). Upon the final release of a new version to the official zite, the next version after will also be released to ZeroMedium BETA. *This will give beta versions at least 2 weeks for bug fixes* before being released to the official zite. This also means that I will be working two versions ahead of the official zite.\n\nSo what does this mean now? It means that later today (it just turned 12:00am as I am writing this) I will release the next version (17.12b) to ZeroMedium BETA. However, because I did not have much time to get this version out, this version will not have very many changes.",

A reason for why this is, which applies to me (but less so I think, since I do post original stuff sometimes) is that developers are too busy with their projects on here. I'm busy with ZeroMedium, ZeroNet Dev Center, ZeroDb, etc. so I can't post much stuff. Ivanq is busy with Git Center and I'm sure some other things. axeltherabbit is busy doing EulerFinder. KopyJane has her own projects (KopyKate/KopyKate Big, and ZeroCat ZeroNet Proxy, as well as other new projects she's working on). And Nofish is of course working on ZeroNet itself (and doing a pretty good job, ZeroNet gets a new revision multiple times a week to fix bugs, etc.). *Along with that, these people probably aren't developing for ZeroNet full-time, either.*\n\nWith that said, what might be making ZeroNet appear dead is *not the zite development, but the content of the zites.* Perhaps this could be because we don't have enough people who are *not* working on a zite that would actually have time to post more content.\nOne other thing that can be paired with this is the exposure ZeroNet is getting and the amount of people joining the network, which both *seem* to be pretty low.",

You can also put posts that other people have tagged you in on your timeline.

Everyone learns grammar in school in the US and I'm pretty sure they do in Britain too.\n\n>  I've learnt some grammar most of the US people can't even reproduce.\n\nIf you're talking about English grammar, I seriously doubt that. The only thing that other speakers learn that people who speak English as first language don't are the technical words for certain grammatical constructs (perfect, imperfect, infinitive, etc.), however, they still learn some (subject, object, etc). But people who speak English who have learned another language do learn these words as long as they apply to the language they are learning. Btw, it's a requirement for many (I would say majority, but I'm not totally sure about that) colleges to take 2 years of a foreign language.\n\n\nFinally, it's very well known in Linguistics that speech evolves faster than writing. This is one of the main causes for why spelling doesn't evolve with changes in speech. Another reason is that when new words are brought into English, they are either not changed or barely changed. So, it isn't necessarily completely the fault of the English speakers for why the spelling is messed up. There was already one time where we tried to change the spelling for English to make it more consistent, it was somewhat successful (I believe one of the changes was using er instead of re?). I believe this was when English was standardized. What I'm mainly saying is that written language evolves slower than spoken language, and for this reason, there really isn't a way to completely get around the fact that spelling is going to either remain or become inconsistent with what is spoken. And trying to change it has it's own problems because not everyone will agree on the changes and a lot of people will forget them or just not obey them.\n\nAlso, something to note, the English spelling rules are more consistent than what people think.",
