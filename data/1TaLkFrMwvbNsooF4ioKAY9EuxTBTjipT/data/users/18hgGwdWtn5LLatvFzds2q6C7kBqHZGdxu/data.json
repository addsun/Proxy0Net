However nothing really happens after I got acknowledgement from the bitmessage, and I am presented the same \"create an ID\" screen instead of obtaining a cert when I visit ZeroVerse. \n\nI cannot imagine that the site is run by manual effort, so there must be something wrong behind the scene. Anyone still using ZeroVerse care to comment?",
