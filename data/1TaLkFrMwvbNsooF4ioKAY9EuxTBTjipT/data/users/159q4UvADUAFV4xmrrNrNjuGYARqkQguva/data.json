It could allow you to forge a deep relationship with someone across the net without the need to divulge personal details. In that way partners would have more confidence that their SOs are attracted to them for their character and personality rather than anything material and superficial. Idk, that's just my take on it. Sounds like a cool prompt for a cyberpunk novel though lol",
