				"body": "The fact that you say everyone else is like a zombie means that you accept yourself as \"Not a zombie\", in this case you make yourself different. Try to focus on things you like , people not always mature in the same age and have different things to consider in their life, for example you might be into programming and someone else might be into money. One way for you to have influence and change the people around you to be better is to be positive and do what you do best with the people that care , and one day your work will be huge and people will get \"attached\" and \"maybe\" see things differently. My suggestions are the following to every human being :\n\nFind yourself.\nFight for what you think is right and what you like to do.\nDo not try to \"change people\" instead let them change themselves by showing them the right example.\nDo not get attached too much into people that are not straightforward and truthful , the rest will come :)",
