I'm willing to put money on Google becoming an ISP first though. > inotamira1: Wonder if things like zero net will wind up taking over...how do these people even think this is a good idea?\n\nIf google became a full ISP, I don't know if that would be a good or bad thing. Googles great about keeping things open, however at the same time, their ideologies are leaning a little to on the feminazi side of things for my tastes.",

They seem to be doing their best to stay neutral politically compared to a lot of other companies which is the best I can hope for. Out of the big data collecting companies I'd prefer Google by far, personally.\n\nThat is true, I think you may misunderstand my intent. It's not that I'd avoid it, it's just that, any company, or collection of people, that winds up in that camp, usually winds up being the most controlling and egocentric companies. Google hasn't hit that point, but given full control over an internet connection, something tells me that may trip them into full power trip mode. I'm not saying that's guaranteed, just that it's a concern.",
