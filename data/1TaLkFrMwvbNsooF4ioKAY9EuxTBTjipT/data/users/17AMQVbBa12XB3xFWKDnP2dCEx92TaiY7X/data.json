UI design plays a role in how people conceptualize technology (as well as interact with it, of course). People have a hard time understanding how to install and use ZeroNet. Your view doesn't take into account the average person, who may not even realize their Documents directory is in their home directory, or that there is a difference between a binary file and an application wrapper. It's because a good UI abstracts away those implementation details and just leave behind *a way to use the computer*. ZeroNet's UI doesn't make obvious that it's essentially an alternative to the internet. It took me, a software engineer, a day or so to find that there was a search engine I could use. The information is not surfaced to the user from the start, there is no easy way to show them the path. The identification management is supremely confusing to someone not accustomed to it. On the internet, people are used to logging in with different accounts - having the same account follow around each zite isn't intuitive and will make the user feel like maybe it's all one website. \n\nMy point is that ZeroNet very clearly could be easier to use, especially for the less technically minded. For an engineer, I agree - ZeroNet is pretty easy. It really feels like it plugs in and works - but I am certain giving it to the average person on the street, they will struggle to get it working, let alone using it effectively to participate in social spheres, create their own websites, or find resources they need from it (like recipes or information).",

[...]\n\nusers.json is the file that keeps track of which IDs you use on which sites. In addition, ZeroMe and ZeroTalk, at the least, keep track of which comments/posts/other follows you see on ZeroHello. Or, at least, that's what it seems like when looking at the json. So as you traverse ZeroNet, posting in more and more places, your users.json will continue to grow, as it needs to keep track of who you posted as where.\n\nRegarding OP ambiguity: Yes. Yes it is ambiguous. This anon is against placing the zeroid.bit key under certs; due to how ZeroNet's certSelect API handles the json, there's the possibility of it overwriting your original 0ID, locking you out of your user account forever. See what happened to [Scrub/ScrubTheSecond](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1White24UrrwQrD86o6Vrc1apgZ1x1o51/1GgNo3CmxPd7n2pMSF3uyqf1XHvgtTUqCe/1495238720) when helo had insufficient backups.\n\nThis anon is currently posting with a slightly-hacked users.json; instead of risking overwriting, I renamed the zeroid.bit cert issuer string to include a description of what the key was, which was enough to force ZeroNet to not overwrite it; see:\n```\n      \"Anon - zeroid.bit\": {\n        \"auth_address\": \"17AMQVbBa12XB3xFWKDnP2dCEx92TaiY7X\", \n        \"auth_privatekey\": \"5KCuecgDtGyLB1u1Z5ErXFmzY5LFCcrUH8rcVHsoLYPgktvDwZ4\", \n        \"auth_type\": \"web\", \n        \"auth_user_name\": \"anonymouslogin\", \n        \"cert_sign\": \"G2Vic5dDAe4DEFnXPisWahbEKjPpTrT5T01UX/ZOgS5CECFcsqiJ589jfHRamnetcwH5423GL58gb4xfXq8yknQ=\"\n      }, \n```\ninstead of OP's version. This comes with the caveat of needing to swap via the purple 0's sidebar and clicking on 'Identity Address > Change', but that's no big deal. I have noticed that this method fails to propagate posts made by a new user auth_key, but appears to be able propagate posts to those user auth_keys which have previously been propagated. Quite the question as to how initial posting works; perhaps a filter searches for the auth_key first, and if found doesn't trigger creation function, while said creation function does not recognize anything other than the certSelect API call's array of accepted cert issuers. Something to poke later.\n\nI hope this answers your question <3",

				"body": "Backwards compatibility doesn't appear like it will be a big problem; with the example source available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroID/blob/master/publisher-http/solution.php), at line 96 the backend uses ZeroNet's cryptSign API to sign a string consisting of the concatenation of the site's public key, a static string (in example '#web/') and lastly the user name. Digging in ZeroNet/Content/ContentManager.py line 648 reveals the cert verifying function, which checks against the site's content.json for the cert_signers key, and fails if it isn't found. Then, splits the string returned by the users.json 's cert_sign being passed through the packaged BitCoin tools. At this point, the name is not used or returned, so the name used in the creation of the cert doesn't matter. Since ```grep -R 'verify(' /path/to/ZeroNet/src``` doesn't seem to show any arguments that could be the auth's name, at least not in that function, and the verify() function seems to be the only one to decode the cert, it stands to reason that one could replace the name entirely and use regexes to make other functions decide how to parse the string.",

				"body": "ANONYMOUS OF ZERONET: Despite the idea of a login to be used by anyone being fuckoff amazing, the implementation has a few consequences attached to it, which affect not only yourselves, but everyone who uses anonymouslogin@zeroid.bit. Since I, probably among many anons, don't want to lose the ability to speak without being traced, please follow some simple etiquette when posting as anonymouslogin:\n\nSince ZeroNet uses public-key cryptography, one must have the private key to alter or delete content as whatever identity. Multiple people log in as anonymouslogin; thus, multiple people have the private key. This creates a few problems.\n\nUno: Since ZeroNet handles content nonrepudiation by hashing all local files owned by a given ID, then signing the content.json index of said files with the private key of the ID, and finally pushing the newly-created ```content.json``` to other peers to propagate, it is of utmost importance to always observe the following rule: ***DO NOT POST, SIGN OR PUBLISH UNTIL ALL CONTENT OF THE ID YOU WISH TO POST HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED TO YOUR CURRENT NODE***. Failure to observe this will result in some anon's content getting irrecoverably deleted, and the next time it happens, it may be YOURS. Please, think of everyone else.\n\nZwei: Anyone with the private key to anonymouslogin, which is everyone ever, can censor, alter or delete content posted under Anonymouslogin's identity. Thus, the user should not assume their content will exist unaltered forever. One possible countermeasure is to post as anonymouslogin, then quote the post verbatim as another user, placing the post's contents behind the protection of an uncompromised private key, thus transferring the trust requirement from the compromised key to one that may be trustworthy. Depending upon the site, it may be necessary to post as anonymouslogin only under a different user's initial post; taking ZeroTalk and ZeroMe as examples, the initial post's existence and timestamp determine visibility of the post, and all child posts/comments require that the parent comment are visible in order for them to be displayed. Therefore, a parent post made under anonymouslogin can be erased by a malicious actor, hiding all child posts from visibility, albeit not from trawling through your ZeroNet installation's json files or content databases. However, since most people don't look for orphan posts, this accomplishes the task of censoring anonymouslogin. Therefore, the best method would be to create a parent post under a burnable identity, post as anonymouslogin, then quote anonymouslogin's child post as another burnable identity. If you are not using anonymouslogin, please quote us, so everyone can benefit from being able to speak anonymously :D\n\nSaan: Logging in as anonymouslogin is just as easy as logging in as your normal ZeroID; however, due to how ZeroNet handles the certificates and keys required to log in, it is highly likely you will overwrite your actual ZeroID, locking you out of your account forever, if you don't handle it carefully. The safest method is to have two users.json files; one with your regular ZeroID, one with anonymouslogin's. Move or rename the ```users.json``` containing your regular ID to somewhere safe, then move or rename the anonymouslogin ```users.json``` to the ```ZeroBundle\\ZeroNet\\data\\users.json```, then restart ZeroNet. Make any posts you want as anonymouslogin, then reverse the procedure to swap back to your original ZeroID. For those willing to dig into the json code itself, make a backup of your original ZeroID's ```users.json```, then check out [this thread](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1_17AMQVbBa12XB3xFWKDnP2dCEx92TaiY7X) (hopefully  still extant) and its comments for more information.\n\nNégy: Avoid using clearnet whenever possible; try running a second instance of ZeroNet off another machine, this one with Tor Only mode enabled, and use the Tor Browser as your UI. Isolation is truly one of the best means of defense. If you don't have a second machine, ZeroNet provides configuration options that make it possible to run multiple instances off the same machine simultaneously; look at the configuration options listed under ```ZeroNet/src/Config.py```.\n\nпять: Even after taking all technical precautions, it is still possible to correllate your identity based purely on social cues such as when and how you speak, language, word choice, time of day of post, etc. Some countermeasures include actively choosing different synonyms than one usually uses, avoid mentioning details that point to your regular ID's known details like machine OS or your favorite pet, enacting more flexible capitalization rules, mixing up gender pronouns, running your text through Google Translate and back, posting at different times of day, avoiding replying as anonymouslogin to your own ID's posts and vice versa, really anything that further obfuscates your 'voice' from the usual behavior of your own ID.\n\nThat's all this anon can think of; if anyone has ideas on how to improve this, please comment, we won't bite :D",

Really.\nDon't you fear that someone hacks your online identity and do illegal thing in your name? \nThat would make much more sense than using this fragile anonymouslogin identity to do such tings.\n\nThis anonymouslogin is extremely fragile. _Anyone_ literally _anyone_ can freely modify and even delete any anon's post or comment. \n\nSo if for example you would like to use anonimouslogin to propagate hate-speech, which is illegal in several countries, this anon and plenty of other anons would simply replace it with something like \"Anyone using anonymouslogin to propagate hate-speech is a FAG!\".

The idea of posting anonymously is a good one.\n\nSection Zwei notes problems with malicious parties attempting to censor anonymouslogin. The proposed solution within needs an uncompromised ZeroID to act as a post, to avoid orphaning comments, so I thought I would make a bot to periodically make such anchor posts on ZeroMe (ZeroTalk is a lesser concern, given that it bumps posts upon reply.). However, I'm running into problems regarding what kind of behaviour I should give the bot.\n\nSome considerations:\n\nWhether or not to automatically quote a post verbatim, to place an anonymous comment where it cannot be easily deleted.\n\t>If quoting, per-hub space becomes a concern. Placing home hub on KaffieHub or similarily-sized hub may prevent some clients from seeing bot's post.\n\nWhether one post would be sufficient, or if the bot should make new posts to which to anchor comments.\n\t>If using one post to which to anchor, to ensure visibility of child posts, modify timestamp to force ZN clients to display it prominently. Modifying timestamps breaks links embedded in posts, prompting a pointer post to provide a link to the prominent post.\n\nTime between moving anchorpost or creating another; how often does one post as anonymouslogin? That, and accusations of spam is a bad thing.\n\nCan anyone else think of consequences to such a bot? If speaking clandestinely is necessary, you can send mail at ZeroMail under the ID ```anchorbot```.",

Instead of one ZeroNet site housing all data in the site, ZeroMe uses the merger sites feature. There are frontend clients, like the default ZeroMe and the custom [ZeroMe Reloaded](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.Mkg20001.bit/), and many sideend sites, called hubs for short, which act as content repositories. When you create a ZeroMe user profile you have to choose a hub, which is where your posts will be stored. Comments made upon your posts, and comments you make upon others' are stored upon that user's home hub. Since multiple people post as anonymouslogin, someone edited the name upon one hub, and signed anonymouslogin's data.json for that hub, with that name. Any time you make a comment or post in that hub, Anonymous will be displayed, while in a hub that has anonymouslogin as the display name, that name will be used. Technically, anyone could change it to whatever they want, but we don't so we don't run around with our heads cut off about the specter of censorship.",
