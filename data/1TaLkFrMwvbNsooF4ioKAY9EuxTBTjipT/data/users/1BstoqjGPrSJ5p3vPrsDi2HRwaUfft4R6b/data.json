From China it really depends on how easy it's for you to leave your country but in general it's about finding a job in another country and if not, there are plenty of countries that welcome people with, let's say $ 100k. It all depends on the country. However you should be ready to adapt to the local culture.\n\nOverall China may lead to the next P2P network solution were even the network infrastructure is decentralized (kind of like Firechat but scaled up).",

Nobody is posting Google propaganda.\n\nGoogle isn't blocking anyone to host this document, including Docs. Also it's more a rant or a way for the author to express himself than a \"memo\". Sundar is actually being questioned for firing that guy, but in any case I don't think that leaking this document did any good to anyone except the press. Now that it's out, it's indeed better to have the full version rather than scandal press selected bits and pieces.",
