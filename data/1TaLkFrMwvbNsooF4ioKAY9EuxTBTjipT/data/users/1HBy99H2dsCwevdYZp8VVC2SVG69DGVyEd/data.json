I just surfed through internet  and  found  key word \"ZeroNet\" and decided to know more about it.  So I start my search from google and found that all articles finished at 2016 . Then I went  GitHub and also found that  almost all related  commits ended at 2016. So I decided to try go to inside ZerroNet and found more information here. Idea is good but from out of ZeroNet it's really looks like it is not developing any more. Also just want to notice that it is really hard to find some information inside it.So i really happy that it is not dead and it still developed.Free internet is a dream that could  become true again!",
