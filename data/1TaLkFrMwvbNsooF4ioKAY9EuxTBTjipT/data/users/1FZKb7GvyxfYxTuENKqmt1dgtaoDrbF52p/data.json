Can't the Chinese be on here for the same reason as them? I was a bit annoyed by the Chinese posts but I feel now its a bit more like a mixing pot of languages, English not so dominant here.\n\nSorry for the disruption that Chinese posts caused though it wasn't me made them. When I clicked the zerotalk button it turned to this forum and I thought it was a default forum with mixed languages...until I clicked English forum button and Chinese one and found out they turned to different forums. It was quite embarrassing to see my compatriots doing such things. Some of us have been appealing for them to stop violating rules here and delete those Chinese topics but I don't know if it would work. Sorry again for the inconvenience they've made.",
