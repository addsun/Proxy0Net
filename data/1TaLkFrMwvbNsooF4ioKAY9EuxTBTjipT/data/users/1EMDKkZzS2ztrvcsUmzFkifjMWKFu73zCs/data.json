My hugest problem was even with my SSD it would lock up the machine once the ram was full and it would parse to the swap. In any case they need LOADS of performance tweaks and possibly a full reprogram. Neat idea though.",

Even if you to delete them, they will stay as long as there are peers.  [...]\n\nInteresting. The UI needs to be rewritten to hide all that then and have them auto drop after 6 months for example. Pretty needless to have them sit there and report for no reason. (Yes I know the reason but for end users its pointless work) Good too know, thanks",
