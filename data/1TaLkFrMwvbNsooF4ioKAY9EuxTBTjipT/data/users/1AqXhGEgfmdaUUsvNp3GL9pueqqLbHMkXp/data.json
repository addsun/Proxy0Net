I still think we can save this amazing thing combining it with Zeronet PLAY+ good torrent player. If you want to see a match or TV pay for it.",

I was wondering to just have a plugin to \"parse\" play and show the movies, on click pass the magnet to a torrent player in kodi. I saw everything separated but we need to glue this in one addon and that is it. I think the parse of the play zite is the key.",

YATP, torrenter, Quasar.\nI chequed the logs but starting to think KODI does not want this kind of players working. Therefore, with the addon parser for play I mentioned above and a propoer player working the job is done in KODI. Webtorren is a good option but not in the OSMC on RPI.",
