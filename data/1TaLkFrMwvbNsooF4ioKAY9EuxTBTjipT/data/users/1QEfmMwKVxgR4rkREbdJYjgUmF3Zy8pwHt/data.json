Same goes with most of the chat out there. Moxie is a curious beast indeed. ;-)\n\nTox is the one I've just mentioned, and Wire is halfway there, since you can use email registration; it's obvious why Wire gets used and Tox isn't: the complete anonymity requires really uncomfortable handshake for first contact, not to mention that's its a way to easy to lose and that means starting the hi-there-where-are-you handshake all over again. :-) [Tor messenger was unusable last time I checked and Riot isn't existing just quite yet.]\n\nAll in all: the list above isn't the \"worst tech\".

You may or may not be aware that English is two language to learn: one written and one pronounced. They have little relation to one another. I would say no matter how many funky \"positive\" examples you try to pull up your sleeve it's all just irrelevant minorities to the huge disadvantage of a spelling distanced from the pronounciation. I don't know how many languages you speak, I happen to know a few, and possibly English spelling is the worst of all. And, as I said, probably Russian is one of the nicest spelling-wise (but I believe sanskrit would even better, it's also using a phonologically systematic writing system, beyond closely following the spoken language).\n\nSo,  what I mean is, when I need a language to communicate I don't give a flying fuck how does it support language history, ancient usage or local accents. These are nice to have, unless they block the primary usage which is clear, simple, effective communication. In case of English they very much obstruct learning and communication.\n\n(And it's even worse, as I heard, since plenty of people with english as mother tongue haven't learnt grammar, they just try to get along mimicking what others do.

It'll do.\n\nI'm not a fan on slavic people, but their language is okay. Spanish and Italian is not that bad either but I'm not familar with the word stems, so lots of work to learn. But all of these are vastly easier for me to learn than some weirdo-looking one like Japanese, Chinese or, say, Urdu. Not to mention their absolutely wasted writing systems. (Hmm, to be honest, devanagari is one I really like, but not Chinese or Japanese.) And obviously the total dictatoric and oppressive  Chinese political system doesn't help to get to like it more. (English is hard to judge, since it's spoken in both the Land of the Braindead [US] and the Medieval Empire (GB). Latter is quite likeable.)",

				"body": "> [krixano](#comment_253_12gAes6NzDS9E2q6Q1UXrpUdbPS6nvuBPu): So, I wrote out a lot of stuff, but I accidentally closed the tab, so I'm not rewriting all of it.\nOh. Okay. This is not the best medium to have a serious discussion, anyway.\n\n>First, You are putting a lot of weight on these so called \"acquaintances\". Try some research - you can clearly see that English Grammar is taught in schools in Britain, it's part of a new curriculum they started in 2015.\n\nYou really must be kidding. So I'm wrong since it's part of the curriculum since, uh, two years?\n\nTo be honest, the long discussions about language have happened a while ago, I guess it's been almost a decade ago. What I say isn't about the current snapshot of the world, it was about people who were grown up there, and speak English as their first language; and these people were all well educated and several magnitudes more fluent and knowledgeable than my poor self. Advising me to research isn't quite fair: I am in no position to know what's been changed recently, and I have no means to research the linguistical knowledge of the population of the age group 30-99. You state that real grammar have been taught for the last 40+ years, I have heard it the other way, and I have no means to prove me right or you wrong. \n\n> I doubt this very much. I think you are lying so hard about this.\nOh that's nice. What's the point arguing with a _liar_, then, friend? (Just for the record: I am not.)\n\n> And I do hope you aren't talking about some tense in another language that doesn't exist in English (not all languages have the same tenses).\nNo. I look up the terminus technicus, stand by.\nThanks for waiting. So it's called \"verb tense\", and there are stuff like \"future perfect continuous\" or \"conditional tenses\".  Something like this: https://www.ef.com/english-resources/english-grammar/verbs/\n\n> I also hope that you aren't talking about them not knowing the technical terms of these tenses.\nNo, that would be unfair. \n\n>Sorry if I don't believe you considering the main mistakes in your English have been how you construct verb phrases/tenses.\nAs this one surely was. I already tried to mention that my grammar is crap and I ain't no native speaker, and my level of English is absolutely not the best possible, and I also make quite a few typos and lazy to read it over and fix. It doesn't change my _knowledge_ though, and since I am pretty interested in linguistics for the last few decades we may say that I have some vague ideas what I am talking about. \n\nWhat languages do *you* speak? On what level?\n\n> What is really pissing me off is how you are looking down on native English speakers because, as you suppose, they don't learn grammar in schools. \nYou are very mistaken here, since this is really far from my opinion. I really love to hear British speakers (and I don't mean TV talking heads but simple, everyday British/English people) since they use the language a way I really like. They haven't got much knowledge about the grammar and the grammatical rules but that doesn't influence their absolutely proper language usage. My opinion is not about their inferiority or superiority, but about the language as being one running much more uncontrolled than lots of other languages around, where people are taught in elementary schools the basic rules and they are aware (on some subconscious level) that there are rules and they kind of keep them working, while English feels like mutating much more than it'd be optimal. This is just a feeling from an outsider, I really cannot even tell you why I have this feeling.\n\n> Obviously they have learned the grammar otherwise they would not know how to speak the language. \nThis is, my friend, a total bullshit. I speak languages without knowing the grammatical rules, just based on the patterns I've learned and the phrases people most often use. Obviously grammar stick after a while, but not as a science but an instinctional mindset. Most of the speakers probably don't have the faintest idea about linguistics as a science, and its rules or definitions. (Again, this is not my peer-reviewed PhD but my opinion.)\n\n>It seems you are also making the assumption that learning grammar in schools is actually effective/useful. \nYes.\n\n>However, there have been research studies that say otherwise.\nOtherwise? You learn grammar and you start speaking worse? Can I doubt this \"proof\" please?\n\n> Also, I'm not completely sure if you know what grammar actually is. \nObviously. You seem to be a pretty unsure person.\n\n> The grammar of a language encompasses the majority of the language, including its sounds (Phonology), word-structure/building (Morphology), word-order/sentence-structure (Syntax), word-meanings (Semantics), and everything else (Pragmatics).\nMy original comments were, if you're into scientifical linguistics, about phonology, and this debate was about morphology, morphophonology, syntax and orthography (in case of Chinese). But even if these are all so nice words, I would rather prefer to talk about \"grammar\", and let the context sort out what I mean. \n\nAs closing: don't act like a minority and don't get offended. I either think you're all shit or think that you're all just humans like me. Either case it's really pointless to prove you're not something you aren't. Oh, and calling names is a different way of debate than debating the opinions.",
