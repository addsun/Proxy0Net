				"body": "Even on the old internet, 'viewing' any website really means downloading files from it, then viewing the local files in your browser. You still have a copy of the files in your cache. So there isn't much difference, once you click on a link to something illegal. You end up with a copy of the incriminating files on your machine either way. The main difference is how long you keep the files for.\n\nThrowing your hands to the heavens and imploring someone to think of the children is a bit stupid on this network. The entire reason zeronet exists, is to resist censorship. Of course shitty and reprehensible stuff is going to spring up here. Shitty and reprehensible people will gravitate towards this technology, as they all slowly realise their stuff can't be taken down.\n\nAs others have said, it's the individual responsibility of every user to police themselves. These sites will only disappear if no-one seeds them.\n\nWelcome to the ultimate Neoliberal paradise. It will be full of child porn and racism.\n\nThat's what you get for valuing freedom above everything else.",
