			"title": "SEO on ZeroNet",
			"body": "Some of you might be familiar with DuckDuckGo a privacy-aware search engine. I am currently building DuckDuckZero, a zite looking like DuckDuckGo but on ZeroNet.\n.\nCreating search engines on ZeroNet is more of a problem than creating one on ClearNet. Indexes tend to be large, even when you only include the website title, amount of peers and some tags. When building DuckDuckZero, I'd like to provide more accurate search results using more information.\n.\nI'd like to brainstorm a bit with everybody about the format of a file (called ziteinfo.json) that developers could include at the root of their zite that contains more information: site name, description, language, important pages (about page, tags page, ...), keywords and also information about the ressources it stores in the db (so that we can index topics on ZeroTalk, individual blog posts on blogs, ...).\n.\nBuilding such an index for DuckDuckZero would take a lot of space, so I guess I'll have to split the index into multiple merged zites. Users would be able to disable/enable searching for individual topics on ZeroTalk, torrents on ZeroTorrent... right from DDZ.\n.\nWhat do you think ? Any suggestions ?",
