				"body": "The major figure in uncovering the Russian Jewish Mafia in America was a journalist named Robert I. Friedman who died in 2002 at the age of 51 from a so-called “tropical disease.”\n\nIn his book, Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America, Friedman interviewed major underground Russian Jewish figures and uncovered their criminal activities in the USA.\n\nAfter Friedman’s book was published, Russian Jewish Mafia leaders put a bounty on his head for $100,000. The Russian Jewish Mafia knows that it can murder with impunity given their working relationship with European and American intelligence agencies. Even the FBI in America keeps no files on the activities of the Russian Jewish Mafia.\n\nIn fact, the FBI, according to Friedman, is loathe to go after Russian Jewish mafia figures because of intense pressure, (and $$$ to key officials), from the Anti Defamation League (ADL). The ADL persuaded the FBI to call off investigations saying that it would “foster anti-Semitism” and bias Americans against genuine “Soviet-refugees.”",
