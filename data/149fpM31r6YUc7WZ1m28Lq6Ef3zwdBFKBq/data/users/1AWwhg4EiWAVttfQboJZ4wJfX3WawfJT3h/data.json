If you want to help her/him make ZeroVoat functional again, you can clone another one from the original ZeroVoat, then add the bug fix you have found and check if they work. Then submit the fix patch to the author. If you can't find the criticial bug, then ask her/him to check his recent changes, iirc my clone is a version in July 1st. Currently I have no interest in improving ZeroVoat clone, so I will just leave it there. ",
