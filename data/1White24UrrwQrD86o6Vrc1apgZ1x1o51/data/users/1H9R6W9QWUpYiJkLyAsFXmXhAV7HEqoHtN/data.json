Those people appear to be much smarter than people who know only one language.\nAnother one reason: you can have your own ZeroNet site just by wanting to do so. You do not need to ask/pay someone else to let you have your own web site. Same with \"registration\" - you just create ID, you do not need someone else to allow you to have one via stupid \"registration\" process.",

You have more of \"freedom\" trying to think about how things work, without evaluating them as \"good\" or \"bad\". And when you do that, \"stupid\" people start to think you're \"evil\" because you think \"it doesn't matter good or bad\". \"Good or bad\" thinking steals your \"freedom\". And \"freedom\" is word which requires at least one parameter - freedom (of what), or freedom (to do what). If you have no something to do, then there is no difference between (your are free) or you (are not free). As like there is no difference between +0 and -0.",
