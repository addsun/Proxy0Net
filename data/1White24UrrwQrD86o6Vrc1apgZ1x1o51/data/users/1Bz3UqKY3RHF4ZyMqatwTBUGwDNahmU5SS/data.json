			"body": "\"I don't really know how they manage to pull this off...\" Well, Whatsapp is owned by a company. Governments can force them to change this end-to-end encryption. And another fun-fact for everyone, Whatsapp tries to make unencrypted backups to the Google cloud. Government could just spy on there.. Whatsapp periodically asks me about it, and I deny (well duhh..). But even if my friends accept, then our conversation is out in the open again. Whatsapp is a perfect example of false sense of security. Truly disgusting..",
