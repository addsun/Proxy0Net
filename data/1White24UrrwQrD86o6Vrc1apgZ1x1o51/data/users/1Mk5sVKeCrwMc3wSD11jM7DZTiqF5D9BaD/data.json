			"body": "@caryoscelus: If you look through the announcement posts on Hacker News and Reddit for Firefox Quantum, people have already posted how to get parts of the old design back, like rounded corners on the tabs. And the dark mode you can change with a theme in the customize section of Firefox, it already comes bundled with the old light design. As for forcing the change by changing the default look, it's probably to make people who tried Firefox before but didn't end up using it see that Firefox is not the same anymore, to get them to try it out again for a while. This is a huge update, the whole rendering stack has changed, it's like a completely new app, but since it's all behind the scenes stuff that has changed it's not really a visible change despite it's magnitude, so maybe this was Mozilla's way of making that change more visible.",
