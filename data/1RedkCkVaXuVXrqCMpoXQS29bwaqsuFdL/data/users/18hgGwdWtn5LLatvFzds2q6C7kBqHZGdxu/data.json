A \"retweet\" is (1) a conscious decision to share some content with followers (2) and optionally with my own comment, The (2) is a crucial way of propagating content and opinions through a social network to stimulate participation. Pure \"comment\" won't cut it, and pure \"reshare\" (or the broadcast of liked content) won't cut it either.",
