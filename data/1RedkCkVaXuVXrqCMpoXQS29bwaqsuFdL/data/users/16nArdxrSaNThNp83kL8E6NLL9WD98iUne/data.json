And for those worrying about censorship, I'm pretty sure there will be plenty of people willing to seed the NSFW hubs :)\n\nThe other benefit to having the torrents in hubs is that it emphasizes the fact that anybody could create their own torrent site front-end and then tap into the same hubs. This also solves the issues that some sites like ZeroTorrent have had where a user would run out of their allowed space on the site preventing them from making more uploads.

Perhaps adding an ability to ZeroNet that lets you easily cleanup optional files that are older than a certain number of days would also be useful for people that don't want to keep really old things around.

The reason for that is because ZeroMe is actually just a front-end to the Hubs, where all the user data is actually kept. It runs locally on your computer where your local ZeroNet is in charge of updating the data in the Hubs you access. So you shouldn't be scared of ZeroMe clones, since the data is controlled by the Hubs. But you shouldn't be scared of hubs either. Since everything you post is signed locally by your private key, so any modifications can easily be detected by the public key you share. \n\nYour ZeroNet private key never leaves your PC.",

It can take a bit for a track to load though since it has to find a peer with the file and sometimes they're on TOR which is slow. There's also no playlist or station functions. Just pick a single song, wait for it to download, and then play. 27GB+ of music has been added. Naturally you only seed the files you've downloaded unless you decide to be generous and download the entire 27GB+ of music.

			"body": "It's real Charlie Chaplin.\nhttp://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-The-Final-Speech-from-The-Great-Dictator-\n\n>The Great Dictator was Chaplin’s first film with dialogue. Chaplin plays both a little Jewish barber, living in the ghetto, and Hynkel, the dictator ruler of Tomainia. In his autobiography Chaplin quotes himself as having said: “One doesn’t have to be a Jew to be anti Nazi. All one has to be is a normal decent human being.”\n>\n>Chaplin and Hitler were born within a week of one another. “There was something uncanny in the resemblance between the Little Tramp and Adolf Hitler, representing opposite poles of humanity, ” writes Chaplin biographer David Robinson, reproducing an unsigned article from The Spectator dated 21st April 1939:\n>“Providence was in an ironical mood when, fifty years ago this week, it was ordained that Charles Chaplin and Adolf Hitler should make their entry into the world within four days of each other….Each in his own way has expressed the ideas, sentiments, aspirations of the millions of struggling citizens ground between the upper and the lower millstone of society. (…) Each has mirrored the same reality – the predicament of the “little man” in modern society. Each is a distorting mirror, the one for good, the other for untold evil.”\n>\n>Chaplin spent many months drafting and re-writing the speech for the end of the film, a call for peace from the barber who has been mistaken for Hynkel. Many people criticized the speech, and thought it was superfluous to the film. Others found it uplifting. Regrettably Chaplin’s words are as relevant today as they were in 1940.\n\n-----------\n\nNofish added that restriction after somebody uploaded the PDF. He says while testing he doesn't want people to upload a bunch of small files, like what PDFs and MP3s usually are. Though the other restriction of minimum filesize of 10MB should've been enough for that. There's nothing stopping you from manually cloning ZeroUp and removing the restriction for yourself though.",
