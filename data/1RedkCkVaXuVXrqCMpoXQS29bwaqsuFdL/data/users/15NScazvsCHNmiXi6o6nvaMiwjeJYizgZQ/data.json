I, for one, will stop seeding all of Erkan's zites and stop using ZeroVerse Mail+ID. I suggest you guys do the same.

Gdm was easiest to install, so when I've only started with Arch, it was only logical to use it. Now, however, when I can handle a bit of stuff on my own, I can move to something else.

In case you still use it, look at this and let me know what do you think.\n\n(we do need spoilers on ZeroMe...)\n\nFrom the letter:\n> I have an idea for ZeroMail: \"pin message\" and \"archive message\".\n>\n>As far as I understand, now messages in ZeroMail inbox get deleted when someone deletes them from his sent folder. It would be great if it was possible to save important messages. Pressed a button, and the message won't be deleted when the author deletes the message. How? Just create a copy of it in a recipient's user folder. (another type of mails in data.json file) The problem is in duplication - ZMail would take some extra space because of that. On the other hand it would become so much more reliable - now I never know when will I loose this or that piece of information. Maybe due to superior knowledge of this tech, you'll see another way to do that, without high growth in size.\n>\n>Since the size becomes an issue and there are always emails that one wants to keep, it may be usable to implement a way to save larger amounts of letters. That's how: you could add yet another type of letters for a user: archived and there to have a single piece of packaged code with all emails separated by some symbol. Since archiving many text items at once gives a huge compression boost, that may allow ppl to store a lot of letters (needs testing ofc.), while reducing overal size of the ZeroMail.",

It's that trick that our brain does to save a lot of computation time - stereotype.\n\nAfter I have found a significant reason not to use Ubuntu, my brain simplifyed it to \"Ubuntu = bad\" to save time when choosing a Linux distro to install.\n\nBefore that, Ubuntu (or rather Ubuntu Mate) was the only distro I've used.\n\n---\n\nBut now it's Arch. I feel free there. It has answers to the questions I have asked for a long time. It makes me think about stuff I would not think before. The only trouble I have with it is called \"fucking-hell-not-the-freaking-installation-no-no-no-not-again-no-please-I-don't-wanna-do-that\". Besides that, it's awesome.\n\nWhich is interesting, by the way. In PC games I love to setup stuff. I remember when I was 12-16 I have played Sims, and there I would spend hours setting things up, choosing personages, building a house, etc. After that I could play for an hour or so and drop it, or start a new game. In Universal Command I've spent days on tutorial missions, printing and reading stuff. And after I could play it without looking in the book, I've dropped it. i've even bought DLC after that without ever launching it.\n\nI think that the most annoying thing for me is that (unlike Ubuntu Live-USB), on Arch there is no persistent storage. So I have to mount partitions over and over again even if I need to do themost simple thing.\n\n..oh my! Now I remember! I have mount and chroot scripts on my PC!!!! I'm a fuckin genious! A real lifesaver. Or at least this evening saver))\n\n---\n\n23:26\nsometimes when I format drives do stuff like `dd if=./arch.iso ...`, I supress an urge to cross myself... I don't do that because it would look like \"oh great Machine God, deliver this data to the storage of my choosing safely, so that I could fix the evil bestowed by my own stupidity upon this machine.. etc. etc.\"\n\n---\n\nCan anyone (who made it up to this point) explain me why on Arch Linux USB, sdx1 is located on tge same space where sdx2 is? That makes gparted useless. Gladly fdisk can see the problem, so I can make sdx3 far away from this strange mix of data.\n\nAh, wait.. I think I get it... It must look as if it is a CD, so sdx1 - is a volume of 518 MB that represents CD itself, and sdx2 is a boot volume that BIOS can load. Sounds crazy even to me. How much wrong am I?))\n\n---\n\n23:44\nMy archiso have killed Ubuntu Live-USB. After I have finished writing Archiso, Ubuntu froze (which usually means corruption of the persistent drive)",

I do not read/browse/view a lot with the mobile phone, since either neck or shoulders are in an unnatural angle.\n\n\nI prefer to hold a small phone and a tablet and a notebook when I can.\n\n- Phone is a handy device that I can SMS from (hate calling, but that too), use it in a train or a bus, without worrying that someone will steal it.\n- A tablet is a thing that I use when I want to read or watch films, or type a lection when I don't have a laptop. But there is not always a place for a tablet, so I take it whenever I can and when I can't there is phone with 4000 mAh that let me both call and watch films (sadly not at the same time, dumb Xiaomi can't split screen).\n- A notebook is heavy, but it's my portable heaven, open it, link up and you are home. So if I can, I take it with me too.\n\nSo yes, my bag is usually at least 3-4 kilos - there is always water and usually food (at least chocolate) wherever I go.\n\nBut truth be told, my current phone has a large screen. Explaining: my tablet's battery has weakened so I can't use it for a long time. One movie and it is dead or almost dead. Can't buy a new one coz I don't work now. So I chose a phone with a large screen.\n\nAbout shoulders: try to hold the phone higher and it's gonna be fine.\n\nWanna know a killer idea? Smart watch. But not that crap that Samsung or Apple sell. I'm telling you about real smart watch. With a full android and no need for a phone. I had one and it was the greatest gadget I had ever. The battery died after I used it in bathroom. Underwater I mean. The problem is that you still need a larger screen sometimes so to have a smartwatch again I would need to but both the watch and a tablet (the setup I had then). No money, so I have a large phone.",

What I think about is that the guys that made it got the whole idea of Starship Troopers films - the more films you make, the shittier they are.\n\nIt's not as bad as ST2, even not as bad as ST3, but when you hear the great phrase for 3'rd time in a single film, it's not even funny already. And when they go on and on and you just loose count, it's too bad even for a parody on ST. And I'm not talking only about \"kill 'em all\", it's also about \"do you wanna live forever?\" and a few others.\n\nAnd when you think they could not do it even more, they do - they repeat \"die on me trooper\" phrase at least twice.\n\nBUT it looks as if the plot at least was good before someone fucked it up. Things that happen there are interesting, but the way they are presented - it's crap.\n\nExamples: (I'll try not to spoil anything)\n- a young and smart sky marshal - good idea, but the way they made it, she's dumb as they come. She should have been blond so that I could make a joke here.\n- the idea of suppressing freedom by force - OK, but they made it as dry as possible. Not wasted completely, but they didn't add anything spicy, so it's boring.\n- action scenes were made very well, but every time there is this \"kill them all!\", so I make a facepalm and miss all the fun (kidding, but hey! stop it!)\n- there are freshmen at the training, but they are so dumb that the sky marshal look smart in comparison. You know what's wrong about it? Read ST book and the enlistment part several times, please. They have only enlisted the best of the best to MI. It's a special force. I know that it's a general purpose army in ST films, but those guys are total dumbasses. Launching a nuke by accident is way too much. Right after the gas rocket. Right fucking after.\n\nSo compiling all my thoughts together, it's like a cartoon for kids, but with blood and gore.\n\nMay be that's what it is actually. Unlike the first one, this had no nudity which made it even worse.\n\n---\n\nI have forgotten to write what I do like about it:\n- not bad special effects, I've liked it. A just bit worse than in the first animated movie, but I have expected worse, so it's OK.\n- Also is features new tech for the series - the jump pack. Now troopers are closer and closer to what was in the book. of course they could not add the jump pack from the book without \"on the bounce\" phrase. But it was OK, because it's the first movie that uses it and in the book it seemed commonly used.\n- And the best thing is that's inviting to watch the first movie. So people who will see this movie first will think \"fine, let's see what wast at the beginning\" - and at the beginning was one great film, and they'll be like \"hey it's great! gotta tell friends\"\n\n... and then they'll watch the rest of the movies and will think \"crap... what the fuck was that?\" but that's another story.\n\n---\n\nI want to sleep and I don't want to read what I have written, so if there are logical or grammar mistakes, just tell me and I'll fix it later. Right now I'm not even sure anyone will even read up to this part so... meow.\n\n---\n\n18.09.17 4:26: First 10 minutes suck like hell, but it gets better.

			"body": "A (already not so) short story before bed time.\n\nI was a teacher once. My university has several schools for children who want extra education (normal school is usually not enough to pass exams in a good university). There are paid ones and a free one. Paid are run by moneybags (like any other school) and have teachers like any other school. The free one is run by a collective of university lecturers, governed and protected by another lecturer, and has student activists to hold classes with children after lectures. Neither get paid there, and all the (little) money the university shares is used to provide children with good education without telling them to pay for it.\n\nSo the thing happened with my second (third?) \"elder\" (you've got to teach the teachers, so there are elders and apprentices among students). Usually there is only one and then you become elder yourself - I could not do it, but I really wanted, so people tried to help me all they could. He was explaining me what I have done right and wrong (mostly wrong), and I have said \"I'm really sorry I can't do better. I try though. But at least we don't take money for it!\" - the last part was intended as a joke, but the answer was something to remember:\n\n-- The fact that we don't ask for money is not a reason to do it bad, it is a reason to do it the best we can. Because we have to deal not only with the regular folk, but also with those who want to be educated and want to go to the university, but can't pay for it. For those we are the last and only hope. The rest are not any different, because now they don't have time to switch schools. So if the teacher can't do the work good enough, they are doomed. You see, it's not about you. It's about that kid that won't pass the exams because you told that you want to teach him, but have not given him required skills and knowledge.\n\nThat's also why no one gets paid - so that there was no extra motivation to do the job.\n\nThat was one of the first times I felt the responsibility for others, and it felt like as if someone was strangling me. Had a hard time breathing for some time after those words... Never liked the idea that someone goes down because of me. And when I got into my university thanks to a great job my teachers did, it was a great shame and a burden to realize that someone won't be able to pass the exams because of me.\n\nThat's why when they have fired me, I felt relieved. Guess that's what they call \"relieved of duty\")",

I can't open the link right from this page - I have to copy it into browser's address bar. I guess that's the safety ZeroNet has for us. Anyway, that's what I wanted to check - \"can I access files from another sites without merger function\".\n\nMy plan was to write a simple site with a script that would play music from another site. Now I know where would that one end.. but I'm not sure I can't stop.\n\n---\n\nOK, what I get is [a site](http://127.0.0.1:43110/18J3x9frN6u7bDpPGecwVXmgK2Jo9T51k2) (which will be up for another 5-20 minutes, then I'll go to bed) that is a clean site with site statistics if you open it from ZeroNet, but has music instead statistics if you open the file by hand.\n\nNow I stop because I really have to get up earlier than usually tomorrow.\n\n---\n\nIs there a documentation on merger function (or just a script for dummies example)? I don't really want to know the whole ZeroNet API, all I want is to make a site that can access resources on other sites. If I need to learn coffee and MySQL and the whole API, that's just not worth it.\n\n---\n\nIn the morning (13:24) I have tried to access those links with my phone and it worked! ZeroNet has politely asked ([proofpic](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/1RedkCkVaXuVXrqCMpoXQS29bwaqsuFdL/15NScazvsCHNmiXi6o6nvaMiwjeJYizgZQ/1505989936)) me if I want to add a new site and then played the music.\n\nEitger desktop version is glitchy and does not allow such access or mobile version is hacky and does too much. @nofish: will you please look into this one? On the desktop I use Firefox and on mobile - still Lightning. I repeat, what's worrying me is that one browser can access the link and another writes \"forbidden\". Is it the way you planned things?",

Windows is hacked to always connect to their proxy and it seems that the only option is to have a USB OS that you bring there and use to connect to the internet.\n\nMy first choice was Ubuntu live due to the simplicity of setting it up (unetbootin > choose iso > set persistent storage size > press a button and wait > done). The problem is that it freezes sometimes and I can't put my finger on the source of this evil. Just freezes completely with no way back. Rebooting sometimes dages storage file and the whole drive has to be made anew.\n\nI think that installing an OS on a flash drive as if it was HDD could solve the problem. Compiling anything on such a drive would be outright stupid, but besides that it ahould be bareable. Arch is certainly one of my priorities here since its using a lot of RAM for caching, which would be a great help on a slow-drive system, but setting it up once again seem like a hard work to me.",

A boy that hates school and more than school he hates only homework.\n\nMy solution is shortly described as \"don't\". Not just that - refuse him ability to do it. And when he gets negative marks at school, make it obvious for him why is that happening, but still don't help him. Don't help until he asks you to. Until you see that it is what he really wants.\n\nThat idea was born from an obvious truth that people know - you can't teach anyone against his will. It is possible to train human like a dog, or parrot, but that can berely be called teaching and I don't think it's either fair (both to a teacher and a student) or humane.\n\nRealisation of the idea was a bit more complicated, since my parents ask, plead and command me to help my brother with his homework. But having quite a nasty character, I told them no. Usually they would ask me extremely politely at first, less politely afterwards and scream later, to no result until today.\n\nToday the request was a touch different: grandmother came to my room and very softly asked me whether I can listen to how my brother reads texts of his English homework. \"He may read if he want. Not like I shall stop him anyway.\" And so he came, **glad** that he got a permission, and read everything, twice or three times if I thought it was required and read again when I told him he can do it again if he thinks he need it. When I ~~told~~ adviced him to write down how to pronounce some words, he jumped and run to get a pencil on the bounce. And when \"the lesson\" was over, he kissed my cheek and thanked me. So I call it a success.\n\nOf course there is a question of quality - when he came, it was my turn not to fuck up so I've kept my ears tuned to the maximum, attention on him etc. while also making it look as if I was listening casually, and I am still not sure he got it all and that he won't get another negative mark... but what is a mark anyway? The kid wanted to do stuff! Not like he wanted to know English or anything like it, but at least he wanted to make his job well. That is enough. There is at least some motivation now AND he is in a good mood (unlike what mood he is in when mother comes to check his homework..)\n\n(too lazy to check this text and I'm suddenly in a hurry, to MK is over and out)",

Simply placing /home there would be both easy and useful.)\n\nYou don't have to use it often, but it adds much needed agility when it comes to partitioning. Plus making backups with LVM should also be easier.\n\nIt may be not needed sometimes - on a notebook, for example. But when it comes to PC, LVM seems a very nice idea. For example, I would make a raid-like volume for my data (may be 3 HDD for important things - LVM is very agile), and spread the rest of the data between 3 HDD without mirroring. And the great part is that it would be only 1 LVM partition on each LVM - and I would NEVER need to change their sizes with any parted or gdisk, I would never be afraid to loose my data - LVM promise that they handle it with care.\n\nIt is not the most important thing one could imagine - yes.. But it is a cool thing non the less.\n\nToo bad it's so hard for me to set it up on Arch and that Windows does not have native support of it (but then windows also does not support ext4...).\n\n(Sorry, too much text, to few things I actually wrote about...
