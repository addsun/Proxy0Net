Therefore, Oracle has made this paid software free. GPL doesn't restrict the sale of the software. It just requires you to release your code, so you can still have it be paid software. However, you can also charge for the source code. So technically **you are still releasing your code, but only to the people who paid for it.** And they are then free to redistribute, copy, modify, etc. that source code once they bought it. **Distribution happens at the point of sale and this is when you get the source code**. Therefore, because of this, I believe the quoted textbook is wrong because GPL does allow you to sell your software, as long as you release the source code *at the point of distribution*. This is how I understand it, but I may be wrong. But I did research this a little and this is what I have read from a few different sources.",

This isn't to say that the restrictions given in GPL are restricting the right things, but it is pretty much still free nonetheless. But that doesn't matter because the definition of Free software isn't *necessarily* the same definition of something that is free.

It lets them determine whether computers are being slow and why, what crashes/errors happened, etc. This has already helped them out a lot by helping them detect and fix crashes. I don't really see a problem with them getting *this type* of information. I think people over exaggerate this stuff. Especially since many companies do the same things.
