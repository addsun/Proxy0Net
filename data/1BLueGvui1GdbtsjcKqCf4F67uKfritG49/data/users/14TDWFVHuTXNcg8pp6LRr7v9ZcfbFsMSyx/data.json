Around three months ago Erkan became very silent, but I hoped he had just gone to spend the summer in Turkey, or something. Instead it turns out he dropped out of ZeroNet. It's somewhat unfortunate, partly because some people were/are using his ZeroVerse ID+Mail services, partly because Erkan has squatted _a lot_ of zero*.bit domains, and of course also because Erkan had many good intentions for ZeroNet.\n\nWell, we can't force people how to spend their energy, so instead of moaning the fact that Erkan has left ZeroNet, let's try to be practical. I, for one, will stop seeding all of Erkan's zites and stop using ZeroVerse Mail+ID. I suggest you guys do the same. Erkan might donate his lot of .bit domains to someone, but I'm not going to hold my breath. If he doesn't (and if he doesn't choose to renew the registration) they'll expire in about 84 days and will be up for the grabs.\n\nPlease spread the word.\n\n/me hops off soapbox",

As for ZeroVerseID, the current situation shows us clearly how vulnerable such a centralized (when it comes to an operator) service is, and I can't see the benefits of relying on such a service.

Initially he kept his “Brazilian” WhatsApp account, but switched to a “Danish” account when he got a new phone.\n\nApparently his former mobile provide recycles their numbers pretty fast. Yesterday, when I wanted to check my WhatsApp account list, I saw that my friend's previous WhatsApp account (the Brazilian one) had a new profile picture — and while it _could_ have been a youth photo of my friend, it clearly wasn't him. And when I asked my friend on his Danish account he confirmed that he no longer uses his Brazilian number, not even when visiting Brazil, and asked me to delete it from my phonebook.\n\nNow, the old conversation had chats and pictures that dated back to at least 2014 (that's as far as I went before I stopped scrolling). I think what has prevented the new owner of the phone number from seeing those chats is that he doesn't have my number in his phonebook, so he wouldn't get the idea of chatting me up in the first place. But what if I had sent him a “Hey man, you've got my buddy's old mobile number, how's the weather there?” message? Or the more unlikely event that I also knew the new owner? Would he be able to see the old chats that he never participated in? That's what worries me.",
