They are special, small files interpreted by the kernel for to point to somewhere else on the filesystem, which the kernel treats as that file. Some caveats apply, such as symlink traversal depth being limited on some systems. They have multiple uses such as providing a single filename for applications to reference a library, enabling easy updating of the library, or allowing access to a certain subdirectory of a filesystem without exposing the rest of it. Hard links are a second reference to the inode in which a given file's data is stored on disk. The two have different low-level advantages; symlinks are seperate files, and as such take inodes of their own, but can point anywhere in the filesystem, whilst hard links do not, but cannot point outside the partition in which their file is located, and all hard links must be deleted to dereference the file from the filesystem and allow the computer to use that space as something else.
