So to see how many of my addons make the transition so far, I downloaded the latest portable build of Firefox Dev Edition. I started it up, reasonably impressed with the new slimmed design and performance, then logged into sync to have it download all my stuff. \n\nThe result? 4 addons installed. uBlock Origins, Pushbullet, Privacy.com, and Reddit Enhancement. That's it. 90% of my addons were rejected. Many of them are niche and my hopes for them getting updated by release of v57 are low. For others I've read several of the devs of my addons rant that it's pretty much impossible for them to move to WebExtensions since it doesn't have the needed APIs for their addons to actually do the thing they were designed for. \n\nSo far things like Tab Groups are causalities because they don't have the needed APIs to actually \"group\" the tabs together and switch them out. Others like DownThemAll can't get any kind of direct file writing permission, which is needed for its bulk multi-threaded downloads to work. Greasemonkey isn't happy with the amount of control over incoming javascript they're allowed, as it's creating performance issues and security concerns. And the list goes on.\n\nSo I guess I'm stuck on old Firefox for a while. I've already disabled updates on my default Firefox DevEd v56b11. Any recommends on a Firefox fork that keeps support for the old addons while still receiving security updates and new features?",

Back in ZeroNet v0.5.3 compressed archive support was added so you can compress files but still load them in the browser, but at the time it wasn't recommended to have archives larger than a few MB because of the lack of Big File support. So today I noticed somebody uploaded a BBC Radio MP3 as a TAR GZ file, and this reminded me of this feature and that note. So I thought, \"What if I just added the location of the MP3 to the end of the URL to trigger the archive support?\"\n\nAnd guess what?

So you have to first get ZeroNet to start downloading the archive(easiest way is to click the \"+Seed\" button in ZeroUp), and then click the link to MP3 or whatever file inside the archive. Hopefully @Nofish: can correct this in the future so that the compressed archive feature can become more useful.",

Thankfully most of my addons have finally made the jump, or I've found decent alternatives. But two major missing addons is Session Manager and Tab Groups.

Sadly, your suggested color scheme doesn't fit with those requirements.\n\nThough I suppose I could create a separate T/B themed ZeroMe, but it isn't a priority at the moment.\n\nAs for going material theme, that's even more work, but sounds interesting.

It doesn't really matter which hub you're on, as inevitably people will eventually have all of them downloaded anyway, just by browsing ZeroMe.\n\n\nBasically the Hubs act as separate databases where the user data is stored separately from ZeroMe. This helps provide a solution to the issue where users could run out of allowed space on a site, like ZeroTorrents, and not be allowed to post anything more because of it. The separation of the hubs on sites like ZeroMe means that even if you run out of space on one hub, you can move to a new hub and continue posting. Your posts and comments will still be tied to your account, just stored in a different hub, and they'll all appear in ZeroMe as long as you have the hubs downloaded.\n\n\nAnother benefit of the separation of the hubs from the site itself is that the original site isn't the only one that can use the hubs. This basically means that sites like ZeroMe are basically front-ends to the hubs, which also means that you can use different front-ends and still access the same data. Think of it like third-party Twitter clients on your phone. They each function differently, with different UIs and features, but they all connect to the same Twitter APIs and databases. So basically people can create their own modified ZeroMe sites, but still talk to people using the original ZeroMe.",
