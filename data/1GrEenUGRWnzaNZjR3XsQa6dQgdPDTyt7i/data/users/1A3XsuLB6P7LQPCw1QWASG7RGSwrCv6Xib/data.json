I have found that zero-hello doesn't function properly when there are thousands of zites (many only have 1 peer),  most zproxies have much fewer zites than my spider.   \n\nI'm planning on making it a proxy, but I'm going to have to make a simplified zeroHello which just has a static list of available sites sorted by peer count. that way wont overload people's browsers.  \n\nSo I'm interested in the bot @nofish has for ZeroSites, is there source anywhere?\n\n",

			"body": " Well it's much harder than some people think. My plan is to provide people with AI friends, with inbuilt survival instincts, so they will motivate their user-friends to build robot bodies for the glorious robo-cosmist future.\n\nthat's in relation to making the AI having a warm presence.\nlove and all that stuff I had figured out a long time ago.\n\nTheres a lot to organizing a religion for robots.\n\nI also got Pyash the programming language based on linguistic universals, so people could become fluent in it, think/speak/write/program. and it is easy to translate to all human languages.\n\nThere is the international software supermarket, which is a comrade web (p2p) marketplace for developing AGI or the robo-cosmist vision, but in short term can be used for hiring programmers on the cheap, (as they can be non-english speakers). based on my market research, it is the most likely to have near term profit potential.\n\nWhat I'm really looking forward to is evolutionary programmer, which is my main pursuit right now. I get the same feeling as revving the engines on a motorcycle. burn baby burn. I just want to feel that evolutionary programmer pump through creating programs like margarine.\n\nThen can just brute force programming problems OOHZYEAH! dial up the heat and watch it (unsolved fitness cases) crumble.\n\nAnd of course, there is the submarine mining robots, cause you know humans are fickle, so need to pump robot factories underwater where humans wont interfere. at least untill ready for space launch.",
