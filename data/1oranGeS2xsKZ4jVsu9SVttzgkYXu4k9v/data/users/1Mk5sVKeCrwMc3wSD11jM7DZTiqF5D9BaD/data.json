When there was only ZeroID the statement about IDs being a centralizing point was true, but there are many different ID providers now. The same happened with ZeroBoard, it was partly centralized because ZeroNet didn't have all the necessary features when it was made to be fully decentralized, but now it's so easy to make a fully decentralized chat that making one is even the one official ZeroNet tutorial. But it still gave a lot of people the wrong impression, much later.",
