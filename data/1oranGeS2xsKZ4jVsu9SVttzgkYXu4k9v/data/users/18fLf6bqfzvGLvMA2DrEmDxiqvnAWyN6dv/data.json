Hope you don't mind my barging in!\n\n> Do I have to create my own gallery hub to be able to upload?\n\n@ulrichard: Yes, so that no one could have control over your content, but you. I believe it is the way a decenteralized web should behave in, so currently there is no plan to support sharing a gallery hub \"officially\". Of course, the site itself does not care about ideologies as long as the data files are there, so you can use some other mechanism to achieve that. e.g. ZeroNet's multiple signers\n\n> the image title between Prev and Back links to the raw image address, though it may be better that it's (also) on the top\n>\n> it may be better that the info panel of photo is in the bottom or able to hide/expand\n\n@Binchan: Nice ideas! Links on both ends should be more convienent, and making the info panel hidden while viewing large images likely won't hurt. Should be easy enough. Looking into implementing them once I fix my build system.\n\n> I need to scroll image or change zoom to view it full.\n\n@ZAlex: Are you on a phone? I was lazy and haven't gone responsive yet, but in case of a missing `viewport`, phone browsers should be scaling the page down until it fits. Text would be small but image viewing should mostly be fine. Not sure what's happening there, but I guess the proper solution is making it fully responsive some day.",

Future proofing for better performance, so that it can run faster when browsers finally support ES6, *is* one of them, but it is not the most important.\n\nMy main objective of using `const` is constraining myself, so that I have less room to make mistakes without the compiler complaining. Mutable states are not only hard for compilers. They are hard for us as well. So I intend to avoid them when possible. It's the same line of reasoning behind the old `use strict`, which does not make much runtime difference, if at all.\n\nIt is also my personal belief, that source code are written for humans, not machines. Even without a runtime effect, a mere semantic difference can convey information to human readers of the code. In this case, `const` makes it clear that a symbol is not meant to be bound to another value. It may be the one thing that the following code deals with, or just a humble single use intermediate for simplifying expressions, but certainly not something that is going to change.

What I can say for sure, is that they are not red, and if you see any red, you should do what the highest voted answer of the question you linked suggested: get a colorimeter.\n\nYou should also keep in mind that a lot of monitors lack uniformity, which means the same color code get shown differently at different places on the panel. You can easily check that by getting your monitor to show a full screen of #FFFFFF. Some monitors come with a factory-calibrated \"uniformity compensation\" option, but if there is none, there is nothing I can do about that, either.\n\nAnyway, it should be easy enough to add a palette to `|><||>`, and with the upcoming settings UI, it should be easy enough to switch between palettes as well.

Now that I'm reminded of that big 0 button by your screenshot, I'm starting to think that it might be better on the bottom instead. Not sure about hiding headers, they look like pretty important info to me, at least, but perhaps I just have a poor working memory.",
