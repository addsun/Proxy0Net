Yes, we found you in a programmatic fashion but I think when you hear who else also got this strange email and what we are looking to do you may be surprised (at least you won't waste your time reading this email). \n\n9 months ago we started with a simple premise, “what if we could rebuild the fervor of the original Bitcoin community?”. This lead to the creation of “Multivac” an algorithm that monitors chat rooms, github repos/commits, and forums of cryptocurrencies. As the community exploded in size, Multivac’s known universe grew to 33 currencies, 36.8 million messages/commits, and at the time of this writing 971,066 people. \n\nInline with the original premise we filtered out: \n\n- All new users with relatively low experience in the respective crypto currency. \n- People with only a few small chats or who had spent little time logged in to the forums or channels. \n- Users with low github interactions & events.\n\nThese filters removed 94.5% of the list. The resulting 63,305 people who remained--of which due to your involvement in you are one--is arguably one of the most densely populated group of crypto currency enthusiasts assembled to date.\n\nAs you can imagine if we do nothing the potential of this community will fade into the ether (pun intended), and so let us explain why we engaged you:\n\nWe know the reason for volatile crypto prices, ridiculous ICO valuations, and over all hype is because of the speculative condition of its user base. If we, as this strong community came together to make distributed apps, smart contracts, and wallets simple to work we will create undeniable value, protect future investors/innovation, and potentially lead by example in this new world financial system. Knowledge is power, let's give it away. \n\n  1. Now that is has come time for our ICO we will circumvent the hype entirely by holding a private sale through invitation codes to only the members of this list. In cryptography and Multivac we trust. This is why <u>there is a unique invite code at the bottom of this email</u> required to participate.</li>\n  2. Build an enterprise grade multi blockchain messaging system that makes it simple--even a pleasure--to work with and use smart contracts, right from inside your chat---bringing the outside world in. </li>\n  3. Unlike Status.im--who only works on Ethereum--we built on Bitcoin and made the messaging platform work on all major smart contract blockchain. This experienced community is small, all developers innovating in it should be able to freely execute any dapp on any blockchain. </li>\n\nYour invite code, re-useable, but truly unique.\n\n[CODE, if this really is no scam (which is very unlikely) xD]\n\nContinue on to the website https://statusrsk.org\n\nPS: To retain the integrity of this community, we ask that this email remains private for you alone. If you don’t continue on to the site don’t worry you will never hear from us again. Thank you for your involvement in this space. We need more of it. \n\nPSS: If you think this was our last stunt, this is just the beginning. We may not have been the first crypto currency, but we will be the last. ",

The bad thing with this is, that _all_ old posts get loaded..\n\nAnd now to the mechanics..:\nThe user marks a post as \"Old\", the post get's cut out of the ```data.json```-File, and get's written into the ```old-data.json```-File, or into the posts specific ```post[XYZ]-data.json```-File.\nThis process would require a way to read out of the ```data.json```-File (so ```fileGet``` or ```fileQuery```), and write into the \"new\" ```old-data.json```-File (so ```fileGet```, and then ```fileWrite```).\n\nYeah....
