The main hurdle is the chunking step which currently requires running a python script in order to generate the files. That needs to be converted to javascript before any kind of Youtube like sharing site can be made. It'd also be helpful if the \"Files\" tab in Zerohello could be sorted and have a bulk select/delete function so it's easier to delete a lot of files, or have whatever Youtube clone include the ability to easily delete videos.",

Don't overwrite the `content.json` file in your zite though, backup the file first. Then open up ZeroMe's and your zite's `content.json` file and carefully copy everything from ZeroMe's between the lines `\"files\": {` and `\"sign\": [` to your zite's in the same position.\n\nReload your Zite and you should now have a working ZeroMe clone. Sign and Publish it when you're ready. You can then modify the javascript and CSS files to your heart's content.\n\nPS: You might want to Rebuild the database using the Zeronet sidebar on your zite. Do note that rebuilding can take a while so you might have to wait a few dozen minutes before your clone is functional.",
