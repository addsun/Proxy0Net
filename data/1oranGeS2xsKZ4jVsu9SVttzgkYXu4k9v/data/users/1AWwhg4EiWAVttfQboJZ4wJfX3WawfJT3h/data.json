No payments or subscriptions beyond the cost of obtaining the hardware. Systems need to be within wifi range of each other for the mesh to be created.

Docket 17-108 is the FCC proposal to slash Title II protections for net neutrality.\n\n> Without net neutrality, all that could go away. The new distro that you would come to love wouldn't come into existence, because the volunteers creating it could not only be limited in their ability to share it with you, but they themselves could be limited in their ability to download the packages that comprise the operating system. We could of course all go back to sharing tapes and CDs, but the explosion in growth and development that rose along with the rise of the free Internet would be hindered. No one, except greedy telecoms, wants to go back in time twenty years to when getting free software involved a postage stamp.\n\nhttps://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/today-july-12th-day-of-action-for-net-neutrality",

In compiled languages, a constant will be replaced at compile-time and its use will allow for other optimizations like dead code removal to further increase the runtime efficiency of the code. Recent (loosely used term) JavaScript engines actually compile JS code to get better performance, so using the const keyword would inform them that the optimizations described above are possible and should be done. This results in better performance.\n\nBut... Const is an ES6 thing, and it seems [Babel can't keep it when converts the js to ES5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40787268/why-babel-does-not-convert-a-const-to-an-unwritable-property-in-a-object)\n> Well, there are no consts in ES5, so there's no way for Babel to compile it into some kind of unwritable variable.

This function wasn’t a difficult thing to understand, and by far, it’s not one of the hard or complex things to reverse engineer, but this one is “small and complex enough” that it’s a perfect example to explain, without writing an entire book or getting into the more complex aspects of reverse engineering. ...",

I guess it may because the dates of feed are too old, likely older than the created date of my ZeroMe account and test hub, therefore they counldn't be added. So I also tried using the current time, because the script was too fast and all the posts were assigned with same `date` XD ([data.json](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9/tmpdata/1BMGV1ZvWQbj5szkqwg7tk5XjiTmFYXUS6/data.json)), and only one or two items displayed in the datebase, and the `date_add` was still `Null`... I also tried deleting the `user.json`, creating a new ID, signing the test hub itself, publishing to proxy, rebuilding `ZeroMe.db` and the results were same ...\n\nI signed my ZeroMe content.json with code below:\n\n```\n    sign_command_path = SITE_ADDRESS + ' ' + '--inner_path' + ' ' + 'data/users/' + \\\n        AUTH_ADDRESS + '/content.json'\n    siteSign = subprocess.Popen(\"python2 ../zeronet.py siteSign\" + \" \" + sign_command_path,\n            shell=True, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)  # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/163542/python-how-do-i-pass-a-string-into-subprocess-popen-using-the-stdin-argument\n    siteSign.communicate(input=SITEKEY)[0]\n```\n\nBtw, adding `follow_id` works.",
