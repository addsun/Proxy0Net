Since each hidden service is generated at ZeroNet daemon boot, that's a lot of hidden services no longer reachable, at least until they timeout. I would not count ZeroHello's peer count as gospel.",

If you wait about an hour, that number should drop, due to the tracker dropping them out of the registry of what to send whenever a node requests peers.",
