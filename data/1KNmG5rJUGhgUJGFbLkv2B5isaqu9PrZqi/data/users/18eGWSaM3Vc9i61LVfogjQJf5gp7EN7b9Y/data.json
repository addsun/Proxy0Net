			"body": "Welcome to ZeroNet! It's not as fast-paced as Twitter, but also not as censored :P You may wish to grab yourself a [ZeroMail](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Mail.ZeroNetwork.bit/) to have a private-ish communications channel with someone. A chatroom that desperately needs more people is [ZeroChat Live](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1XdLr61DgYL2RLFzb6aDMxhbzHSP5sbrx/), a good introduction to ZeroNet can be found at  can be found at [ZeroWiki](http://127.0.0.1:43110/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:zeronet), and more zites can be found at [0list](http://127.0.0.1:43110/0list.bit/). Keep in mind, since ZeroNet copies all data served to your disk, you'll want to have a budget set up for optional files. To do so, go to ZeroHello, click FILES near the top-left corner, wait for it to expand, then on the top right there will be an USED: xxx.xx KB/yyy.yy indicator. Click it and set a percentage. This is a percentage of the disk space available on the partition in which you unzipped ZeroNet. I recommend using an entire second platter drive, for maximum space and least wear and tear due to constant writes. Yes, I did just copy/paste this from my previous posts.",
