Once ZeroNet has downloaded it the browser can access the local copy. \n\nOnly exception to this that I know of is ZeroMux which chunks up large files into pieces before adding them for sharing on ZeroNet. When a user then downloads the file it's actually asking for a bunch of small files, so for example when 5 out of 100 pieces are downloaded, 5% is known to be complete. Once the user has all the pieces, javascript in their browser then combines them on-the-fly into one coherent file they can save or view. Though the latest ZeroNet update seems to have broken ZeroMux and it hasn't been updated yet.",
