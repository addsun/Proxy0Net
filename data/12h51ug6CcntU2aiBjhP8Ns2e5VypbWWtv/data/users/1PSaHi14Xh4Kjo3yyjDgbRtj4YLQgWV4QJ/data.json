I didn't even get a captcha.\nHere is what I was trying to write:\n\n\nBitcoin is the future!\nPrivacy is only one feature, and it's often misunderstood. Bitcoin is only private if you are very careful about that aspect. \n\nBut it has so many advantages over any existing means of payment:\n* asset based\n* cheap transaction fees\n* no holding fees\n* you can create as many accounts as you like to compartmentalize your holdings\n* no requirement to bind an account to one person\n* accounts can be shared between individuals or machines\n* the car could have a bitcoin wallet and directly pay for electricity, parking, roads... maintenance\n* can't be stolen as long as you hold it yourself and take care of your private keys\n* no devaluation through (centrally planned) inflation\n* In case of a dispute you can proof an unfalsifiable payment on the public immutable blochchain\n* has escrow built into the protocol\n* no chargebacks\n* settles in seconds for low values and one hour for extremely high values.  \n\nYes it is more volatile than legacy currencies, but it gets better over time and generally trending upwards.\nThere are payment companies that handle the volatility and conversion to USD for you for a fee that is one fourth of credit card fees.\n\nSo, yes Tesla should look into Bitcoin.

I want to pay for what I use, not a fixed rate per month, and then be locked into an ongoing contract that is hard to get out again.\nSo I launched another attempt at paying for content. \nSpecifically, I didn't even know how I would go about watching Game of Thrones legally. I really wanted to do the right thing for season 7. A friend told me to go to the HBO website. So I did, and actually found the [episodes for season 7](https://hbo.co.uk/game-of-thrones/season-7)\nThe episodes list 7 different options to buy. \n* apple itunes: I have no apple device and no itunes. My browser reports: itmss is not a registered protocol.\n* Amazon: The website asks me to activate DRM in the browser. No thanks! I don't buy stuff that has DRM! And I don't activate any binary blob in the browser!\n* talktalktvstore: The website displays a banner, that you can browser the stuff, but I can't watch it.\n* google play: I didn't use a google account in years. No idea what I would get if I reactivated my account. How I could pay, and where I could watch it. Specifically, I don't have an Android device.\n* rakuten: We are deeply sorry but Rakuten tv is not available in your country.\n* playstation store: I don't have a playstation, and the browser displays: Access Denied\n* Xbox store: plays only on Windows, this implies DRM\n\nNothing working! What does that leave me with?\n\nOn the other hand, I love [reelhouse](https://www.reelhouse.org/) where I can pay for the DRM-free movies with Bitcoin. Just the selection is very limited.\n",

Going back to Gnome didn't sound like a big deal to me. They always made sure the default environment worked very well in the past. But this time...\nI was not able to log in after the first reboot. The bluetooth keyboard didn't work. My first thought was that I would have to re-pair under the new desktop environment. So I plugged in a crappy old keyboard to log in. After pairing the BT keyboard again, it worked .... for a few minutes. After some playing around I figured that it keeps working only if I use it constantly. As soon as I pause for more than two or three minutes, it's gone. And after the next reboot it is gone as well.\nI find it hard to believe that I'm the only one using a bluetooth keyboard with Ubuntu.",
