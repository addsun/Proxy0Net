Comments should be on the hub of post's author. And for better interoperability, user profile info and post previews (with tags) can be stored on shared hub.\n\nBut there is a problem. To publish a new zite/hub is not easy if the port  15441 is closed. Maybe blogs on standalone hubs should be an optional feature. ",
