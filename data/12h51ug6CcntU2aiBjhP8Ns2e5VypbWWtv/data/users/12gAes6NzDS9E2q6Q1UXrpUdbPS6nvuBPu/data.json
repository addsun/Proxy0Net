Punctuation includes: . , ! ? ( ) [ ] { }\n* You can now add images while editing a story\n\n### Bug Fixes\n* Empty responses and stories are *kinda* disallowed (There is still a bug that I'm unsure how to fix)\n* The \"publish\" button is temporarily disabled after clicking it when publishing a response. This prevents people from accidentally clicking it twice, which will post the response twice.\n* Images that are uploaded will have the date uploaded appended to the filename. This ensures that there are no collisions with image names.\n* For images that are uploaded with non-ascii characters in the filename, the non-ascii characters are removed - this is to prevent a ZeroNet bug with non-latin characters. Spaces are also replaced by underscores and quotes (double and single) are removed.\n* The registration will not continue until you select a primary language and enter a username.\n* When posting edited story, if title is same as before, no need to add date to end of it\n* When interests is empty and you click to follow an interest, do not start the interests string with a comma ','.

What *will* change is when versions are released to ZeroMedium BETA. Upon the final release of a new version to the official zite, the next version after will also be released to ZeroMedium BETA. *This will give beta versions at least 2 weeks for bug fixes* before being released to the official zite. This also means that I will be working two versions ahead of the official zite.\n\nSo what does this mean now? It means that later today (it just turned 12:00am as I am writing this) I will release the next version (17.12b) to ZeroMedium BETA.

Once that happens, the client updates, looks through the \"users\" table for the current user, finds which \"cert_.json\" file to look at, and get's the certificate from that file and verifies the id was created.\n\nNow, I know that KaffieId doesn't rely on a server, and uses the certAdd cmd, but does it have a database that stores all of the user's ids? I'm guessing not because that would have to rely on an id provider, right? So how do clients verify ids that come from KaffieId?",

If a particular word from the search query has no matches, it will lower the result by one [they are basically like ordering points, I guess], unless it's in strict mode, then a result that doesn't match all words from the query will not be shown. If none of the words from the query match the result, it won't be shown (in *and* out of strict mode). You can see the algorithm [here](https://github.com/krixano/ZeroExchange/blob/master/src/router_pages/topic_search.vue#L62).\n\nHowever, the main problem with this algorithm is that it needs *all* of the possible results (all questions in this case) to be stored in a variable and used in order for it to be accurate. Therefore, you can't do a database limit, offset, and pagination. So, I am going to eventually experiment with implementing something in SQL so that we can do the pagination stuff and still have a good searching algorithm.",

To say it's crap because not all of your addons are supported (especially when you haven't given the devs enough time to migrate the extensions) makes no sense to me because extensions is only **one** part of the browser (you don't give 1 star to an app if they only missed a small feature that you want - if you do, that's kinda crap). I get it, you want the old extensions back, but security should come before that I think, and as far as I know, WebExtensions are more secure *because of* their limitations. An added benefit is that extension devs can use more of the same code between Chrome and Firefox versions. Also, WebExtensions will make plugins not break everytime Mozilla wants to add new features to their browser. Overall, I think this change had to come sooner or later (multiprocess Firefox would have broken many extensions anyways). Obviously it'll be tough to migrate all the extensions, or wait for features to allow some of the ones that wouldn't currently be supported to be migrated, but you just need to be patient.",

It kinda puts a lot of focus on discovery of these stories too. There's topics and tags, interests on certain topics that will recommend you different stories based on them, etc. The way I implemented topics was for them to reference tags that work within that topic.

I just think that with paid software, they can have a greater motivation often times than open source because they are relying on the money their product is getting for their income. And when that external motivation pairs with an internal motivation, that's going to be greater than just internal motivation alone. Here, I'm mostly talking about independent and indie developers than don't just want the money, but are also making their products to create better software for their customers - an intrinsic motivation of improving the software climate.",

You can have proprietary and paid software that's one of the best. You can also have this with open source. What makes it one of the best isn't that it's open source or not. It's that the developers were motivated enough to make it good. And with paid software, the developers are rightfully getting something for their work.\nHow this relates to Microsoft is they aren't motivated enough to make it great. This comes from whether people are still using the software regardless - perhaps because of nothing else that's better, which is exactly what I meant by competition.",

			"body": "@Polar: You're obviously not reading what I'm writing, and you can't even bother to read the code I posted so I'm done with this argument after this.\n\nFirstly, I haven't ever said that the cert wasn't received via HTTP POST. It could be, idk. However, once ZeroNet received the updated files for ZeroId, as per the code I posted below, It looks up the auth address in the files. The reason why it does this is because it uses the auth address from the \"Unique User\" selection rather than by having you log in to your zeroid (and no it doesn't automatically log into it after registration either). Therefore, there is no certificate stored that it can decrypt to check for your zeroid. Instead, is takes the auth_address from the Unique User selection (which is default) and checks the list of users to see if it exists. If it does, it shows the information. This is also used when you visit the zite in the future, since your certificate isn't stored (since you're not logged in, remember).\n\nNot only have I provided you with the code that supports exactly what I am saying, I have given you proof that such a list of users exists (via [this link](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/12gAes6NzDS9E2q6Q1UXrpUdbPS6nvuBPu/1512383277)). And btw, that file you linked to only returns \"OK\" ([here](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroID/blob/master/publisher-http/solution.php#L116)). And Furthermore, this code supports that fact that that file you linked to only returns \"OK\" and nothing else:\n```\n$.post \"https://zeroid.qc.to/ZeroID/solution.php\", {\"auth_address\": @auth_address, \"user_name\": $(\".username\").val(), \"work_id\": task.work_id, \"work_solution\": solution }, (res) =>\n\t\t\tif res == \"OK\"\n\t\t\t\t@setRequestPercent(80) # Solution ok, site change published, waiting for update\n\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t@cmd \"wrapperNotification\", [\"error\", \"Solve error: #{res}\"]\n\t\t\t\t@endRequest()\n```\nAnd, hey look, it even says `waiting for update` in the comment.",

			"body": "@Git Center: When a user registers for a provider, they are given a signature. This signature is just the user's information (username, portal type, and auth_address) put into a string and encrypted with a private key. This signature gets copies over to not only your `data/users.json` file, but also any `content.json` file you have on any other zite. When ZeroNet verifies that a user belongs to a particular id provider, all it has to do is decrypt this signature (from your `content.json` file inside your user folder on the zite) using the id provider's public key and check that the information from that decrypted string is the same as what is in the user's content.json file (because the content.json also lists the username, portal type, and auth address is given from directory). The only question is how does ZeroNet know the public key of an Id Provider? This is actually very simple. It can get it from what the Zite Owner put in the \"cert_signers\" part of their `data/users/content.json` file (the part where you put something like `\"kaffie.bit\": [ \"1KH5BdNnqxh2KRWMMT8wUXzUgz4vVQ4S8p\" ]`). This public key for KaffieId was given on the homepage.\n\n> Also, do you know when are ZeroID users verified? E.g. can I change my data/users/.../content.json's cert_user_id to nofish@zeroid.bit and signature to use nofish?\nYou can now see where the problem with decentralized Id Providers lies. You cannot do this with ZeroId because you need ZeroId's private key to be able to create the signature. However, you *can* do this with KaffieId (e.g. changing your username to glightstar@kaffieid.bit) because it's private key is public. This would pretty much be the same as using that change username feature on the KaffieId zite, except that it will store the changed username in your `data/users.json` file for you (but you could do it manually yourself).\n-\nBasically, the way ZeroNet verifies users is very similar to how it verifies zites, by using these signatures that were encrypted by private keys. It decrypts them and checks if they match what they should (hash of content.json for zites, user info for users).",
