It happened to the second one even faster than it did the first. Throwing numerous other small issues I had with both into the mix, and I've sworn off ever buying another HP laptop again.\n\nI'm now using a Lenovo y50-70. I've had zero issues with the hardware besides the slow SSHD that it shipped with, but that has since been replaced by a 1TB SSD. Other than that it's worked great, except for the fact that I'm stuck using Windows on it because of the graphics software I need to use :P  So I haven't tried installing Linux on it myself, but from what I've read of others experience people have gotten distros like Ubuntu working fine.",

Modern Virtualization utilizes more efficient methods to emulate old hardware/interfaces needed by OSs, like mapping them to their modern equivalent though this requires a CPU that supports Virtualization. Windows XP is perfectly supported by VMs like Virtualbox, and runs amazingly even on top of another OS. I boot Windows XP in VB and I get to the desktop in seconds even though I only gave it 1GB of RAM and a single CPU core. Pretty much the only thing that's a headache in a VM is running GPU intensive programs, but it sounds like you don't need that anyway.\n\nI just don't get why you'd need to perfectly emulate an old chunk of hardware in order to run Windows XP well on a modern PC.\n\nThough if you really want to fully emulate a x86 PC and run Windows XP on it, x86 emulators like [Bochs](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/) already exist. And people are even running Windows XP on their Android phones now.",

I'm already sick of all the Javascript redirects and popups on mobile that make it literally impossible to visit sites without my adblocker on. I have no choice but to choose between getting harassed or not funding the site I'm visiting. I hate that but there's little I can do, or even what site operators can do. The best solution would be for Ad Networks to prevent javascript in the Ads they serve, but the likely hood of that happening, especially with the more \"flexible\" Ad Networks, is low. So the only other way would be for Browser makers to fight back, because if they don't this malicious advertising is going to keep happening.\n\n The motivation for Google to do this might actually be because people could be switching to other browsers with addons or built-in adblockers, especially on mobile with Chrome not supporting addons. This not only means people are ditching Google's browser, but also opting for choices that involve blocking Google's Ad network as well, despite Google doing a lot of effort in preventing these Ads on their network. Because at the rate things are going Ads in general are going to become worthless as more and more people block them, killing a primary revenue source for Google.",

Though if they do decide to punish certain sources like the article mentions off-hand, then they'd be open for antitrust and abuse. But if they stick to blocking types, then they'd be in the clear for the most part. Any legal complaints could be quelled by a good lawyer basically stating that these malicious Ads were damaging their software's reputation and endangering their business.",

Before ZeroNet had to download the entire file from a single source, which is okay for small files, but with large files it's unreliable since you have to download 100MB+ of data from a single source that may go offline at any time or have really slow upload speeds.",

It's an Anime service available in a few Nordic(English subs), German(German subs), and French(French subs) regions. They have a streaming subscription, but also a purchase option. And the best part, the purchased videos can be downloaded as high-bitrate DRM free MP4 files. I was able to access them via a Swedish VPN and pay using my US Paypal(Visa and Mastercard are also accepted). You pay using credits, with 1 credit = 1 euro. What's interesting is that 1 episode is 1 credit, and a full-season (usually 13 episodes) was 10 credits, but to test it out I bought one episode and discovered that the full season price had actually gone down to 9 credits! I've never seen adaptive season pricing like that on other VOD providers. Really nice service. Just wish my Swedish VPN was faster so that I didn't have to wait an hour to download a 3GB 1080p video.",
