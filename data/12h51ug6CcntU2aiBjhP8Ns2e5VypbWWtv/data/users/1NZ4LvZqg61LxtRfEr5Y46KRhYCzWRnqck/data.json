Recently I learned that Diazepam is also used for some kinds of pain management, which surprised me since before I only knew it as an anti-anxiety/antipsychotic/sleep aid.\n\nAlso, probably are robots. Try to trap them in a logic loop, see if their heads pop off. :B",

Little bit of an adjustment period to the UI but feels more natural than android or iOS.\nYou should be able to get an Intex Aqua fish off ebay orâ€¦ somewhere.\nI have a Jolla C which is identical to the aqua fish except the OS lacks some of the intex branding stuff.",
