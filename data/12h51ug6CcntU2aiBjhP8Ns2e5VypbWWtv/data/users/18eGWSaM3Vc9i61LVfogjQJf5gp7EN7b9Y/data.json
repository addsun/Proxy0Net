			"body": "@U808f: Echoing @Jayofthezero here; net neutrality laws force ISPs to not discriminate on data passing though there networks; it's why it's illegal to throttle BitTorrent traffic, or prevent a reporter's findings dump back to that reporter's HQ. However, due to the language of the law as written, it has not forbidden zero-rating, or the practice of favoring one companies' content over another, such as Netflix being throttled and Hulu being sped up. If net neutrality laws did not exist, then ISPs would be able to choose who got to see what, to an even greater extent than now, up to, including, and past promoting ISP-favored content companies (read: supplicants and extortees) and blocking startups from getting off the ground, further entrenching the ISP's monopoly power. This is why John Oliver did two segments on it, to raise awareness and prevent our corporate overlords from fucking with the connection even more. (YouTube vids, [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak)). In short, letting corrupt ISPs dictate who passes through when and to whom is a recipe for bribery of ever-higher amounts simply to stay in business, decreased competition in every market and all the effects thereof (higher prices, lower quality, fewer jobs) and preventing innovation of things you've come to take for granted, such as the smartphone in your pocket and cars you drive. Without competion, well, look no further than the set-top box you've been using in your television for the last twenty years; which has changed more, and which is more useful?",
