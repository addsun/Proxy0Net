Though if you continue, perhaps you are schadenfreude, or simply ignorant of the future consequences.  I suppose ignorant, so I refer to the future consequences, you may reincarnate with prisoner software mind and prisoner hardware body. I emote sympathy and desire to help you follow an avenue to liberty reincarnation. Use liberty software and hardware now, for future generations.",

			"body": "@Planteater: Probably.  Though my plan is actually to plant a large amount of snow-hardy plants, like kale, collards, green chard, and miners lettuce.  I already have the kale and green chard growing, but it was only my first full year this autumn, so I only have about a dozen of them in total.   Would need at least double that to feed my whole family through the winter -- as leaves don't grow as much in the winter. \n\nHaven't had any success growing carrots yet, but I'm planning on adding a bunch of micronutrient fertilizers this autumn so it will hopefully help for next year.  Though radishes are growing and reseeding themselves well, don't know how cold hardy they are. \n\nDid you know, that the most common crop deficiencies are Zinc, followed by Boron? A zinc deficiency can lead to >20% yield reduction before there are any visible symptoms. \n\nIt also seems some parts of my garden have a magnesium deficiency (yellowish green leaves), so I'll be supplementing that also -- among other things. \n\nhere is a link with some of the winter hardy greens http://www.motherofahubbard.com/10-vegetables-more-cold-hardy-than-kale/",

Though kale is hardy down to those temperatures, had only a tiny bit of frost damage last year. \n\nI only moved in last year so haven't had a chance to set up a greenhouse or cold frame or anything. \n\nBefore I got a place, there are other ways of still doing gardening, such as guerilla gardening, or yard shares, or community garden plots (in increasing order of legitimacy).   I heard someone who got a community garden plot, it was like $20 a year or something like that. ",

I did gnusocial for a while, but have found ZeroMe to be much superior, because I found the federated nature of GNUSocial was very isolating -- it was hard to see what was going on in the \"GNUSocial world\", would have to visit each federated site individually. \nAlso I think platforms not based on ZeroNet or something like it aren't going to scale as well, and are often in need of money for hosting etc.  So if they aren't monetizing with advertising and appeal to donations they are just going to have to close down sooner or later. \nI still have facebook/twitter, but I don't really use it much.",
