			"body": "yes. That's the beauty of zeronet. Someone a while back had the concept of putting his zeronet on his boat and had it synced up. When anyone from the ship got back to shore it would sync up with the rest of the network. This is a concept idea of course (and he probably got it working but he never updated us on it), but it should work. Zeronet is designed to be as p2p as possible. The only thing currently \"required\" is the tracker. But I think if we could get zeronet to allow ip addresses to be manually entered and have zeronet save the ip addresses of old peers, the tracker would be unnecessary.",
