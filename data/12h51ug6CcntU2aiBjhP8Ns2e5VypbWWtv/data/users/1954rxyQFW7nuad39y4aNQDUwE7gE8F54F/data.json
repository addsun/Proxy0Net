Smart phones need data to be smarter. Apple may prefer to store and process more data locally because 1) Apple is sure its device has the power to process it 2) it saves the cost of Apple's servers. But Google may prefer to store and process more data remotely because Google is selling ads. To sell more ads, Google need to put Android on as many devices as possible, including low end devices. Also, collecting and processing more data on its servers helps Google sells more accurate ads.",

			"body": "CrahPlan Configuration\n\nThe default settings are not optimal.\n\n- **Deduplication**. Deduplicating small files slows backup process dramatically and saves little space. The default value `Automatic` uses `Full` on WAN and `Minimal` on LAN. Change it to **Minimal**.\n\n- **Compression**. Compressing already compressed files like mp3 files slows backup process significantly and saves no space. The default is `On`. Change it to `Automatic`.\n\n- **Frequency**. The default is `15 minutes`. Change it to **1 hour** or longer. Otherwise if a large number of frequent changing files is included in backup settings, these files will defer backuping larger, old (sometimes more important) files since CrashPlan gives priority to small, new (changing) files. To utilize CrashPlan's 'unlimited' space, those regular changing small files should use other tools to backup, for example, VCS for code and documents, restore points for Windows system files.",
