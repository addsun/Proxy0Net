			"body": "Alright, so everything seems to be in order for my new awesome hub and cleanly migrating hubs for those of you who want to switch to my hub, or the infinity one (or even Red->Blue/Blue->Red for you color traitors).\n\nFirst things first is to seed the new hub you want to switch to. You're likely already seeding Red and Blue, but you'll need to seed the [Kaffie hub](http://127.0.0.1:43110/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv) or the infinity hub, if you want to switch to those. If you're seeing this post, you should already have the Kaffie hub.\n\nDon't bother going to the 'create profile' page. That's for suckers. It's nice to check which subs you're seeding, but the 'create profile' button just messes things up. Instead, go to your home sub (you can figure out what this is by hovering over your name and looking at the URL) and go into the /data/users/[your id]/ folder. You'll want to copy over this whole folder into the new hub's equivalent.\n\nIn the destination hub, open up content.json in a text editor (like sublime, so formatting doesn't get messed up). All you want to do is edit 'address' to point to the new hub, instead of your old one.\n\nNext, open up data.json in the destination hub. You'll see all your original hub data. Here's what we're going to do. Delete all of the entries under 'comments'. These are comments relating to the hub they're in, so you don't need them migrated. You should still keep the array though, since that's where all your new hub comments will go.\n\nChange the 'hub' to the new hub you're migrating to. Just like you did in the content.json. This is a reference to say what your 'home hub' is. We'll eventually edit this in EVERY hub you're seeding or posted in, but one step at a time.\n\nChange 'next_comment_id' to 1. Since we deleted the comments, we need to reset the counter.\n\nHere's where you get a choice. There's two options for your posts. Either you can migrate the data, which switches the name link on those posts (and hosts it in the new hub) but also unlink everyone's comments, or you can leave the posts in the old hub, and start fresh. If you start fresh, your old posts will still appear, but they'll link back to your old hub profile. So keep that in mind. I personally started fresh.\n\nTo start fresh, do the same thing to your posts as you did your comments. Delete all the entries and change the 'next_post_id' to 1.\n\nLastly, delete everything under 'post_like'. Keep the array though.\n\nThat should set up your new hub account. Now we need to repoint your data on the other hubs. For each hub you've posted in, go into that hub's folder and find your user folder, like we did before.\n\nOn each one, open the data.json and simply edit the 'hub' variable to point to your home hub. This is probably optional (as it repoints the comment links), but I went ahead and did it to reduce the amount of problems.\n\nOn your original sub, a couple more things need to be tweaked. Delete everything under 'follows'. Remove the variable entirely. Delete 'next_follow_id' as well. Change 'hub' to your new hub, as usual. And if you opted to migrate your posts, delete the entire 'posts' section along with the 'next_post_id' variable. If not, leave it. I didn't migrate, so I left the posts there.\n\nChange the intro to something to notify people to switch the profile they follow. This is technically optional, and you can just delete it if you feel like it. Delete the 'avatar' if you migrated posts (it's unneeded), but if you kept your posts there, then you'll want to keep it, as otherwise your old posts won't have an avatar (perhaps this is preferred?)\n\nFinally, we save up and go to sign/publish our changes. Visit each hub site (the actual site down at the bottom of zerohello, not zerome). Then drag the sidebar open and select 'i own this site'. Put your user content.json in the bottom box (should look something like: data/users/[yourid]/content.json) and hit sign. It'll prompt for a privatekey. Use your ZeroID private key (found at the top of your zeronet's user.json file) and then click publish. Do this for every hub you've edited.\n\n---\n\nSo now all of the changes are made and published. Everyone else should see everything just fine. But you might still be stuck logged into your old hub. So delete every hub but your destination hub. Then go into zerome and ensure you're logged in properly. Finally, redownload each hub and everything should be good to go!",

			"body": "Update on the login issue for KaffieID. The login code detects your cert name, which is the little `name@zeroid.bit` and then compares it to the one in your `content.json` file. If they match, it sets that as your user. If not, then it doesn't. So username switching systems, or people with matching names/providers (such as nanasi/kaffie that don't guarantee name uniqueness) you get login issues. And switching an id (even with the same auth keys and such) makes a login issue, despite signing working correctly anyway.\n\nApparently the only think you need to change is the content.json in your home hub, to fix this. just change `\"cert_user_id\": \"name@provider.bit\",` to whatever it is that is in the top right (your cert name). If this field is missing, there'll be issues. And if it doesn't match, there'll be issues.\n\nThe fix I posted below (changing the detection in all.js) to be based on auth_address) works as well, and lets you log in regardless (so if your signing is good, you're all set). Though amusingly, the little `name@provider.bit` that appears everywhere *is* based on that field in the content.json. Interesting...\n\nI'd still like the change to all.js to be made though, so that this issue doesn't occur. Having broken logins is never good.",

			"body": "So there's been signing/publishing issues issues with KaffieID and I seem to have found out why. When there's a cert_sign in the content.json, ZeroNet attempts to create a new cert to recreate the cert_sign to verify.\n\nHere's the relevant code:\n\n```\ndef verifyCert(self, inner_path, content):\n        from Crypt import CryptBitcoin\n\n        rules = self.getRules(inner_path, content)\n        if not rules.get(\"cert_signers\"):\n            return True  # Does not need cert\n\n        name, domain = content[\"cert_user_id\"].split(\"@\")\n        cert_address = rules[\"cert_signers\"].get(domain)\n        if not cert_address:  # Cert signer not allowed\n            self.log.error(\"Invalid cert signer: %s\" % domain)\n            return False\n        return CryptBitcoin.verify(\n            \"%s#%s/%s\" % (rules[\"user_address\"], content[\"cert_auth_type\"], name), cert_address, content[\"cert_sign\"]\n)\n```\n\nThis means that only certs that have signed using `useraddress#authtype/name` are valid. Which eliminates the ability to change names but keep the same cert. This verification requiring the name is entirely useless, and you can get around the entire issue by modifying the content.json to simply not have a cert_sign.\n\nSo... what should we do? Just force everyone to use the `useraddress#authtype/name` and hope that no one pushes out a cert that uses something different? KaffieID uses `useraddress#authtype/kaffie.bit` so that names can freely change. However, that seems to mess up the python verification. The cert works, it's just unexpected due to not using the name. Should I just change KaffieID to mess up certs when you change names? Seems kind of dumb that changing a name for an ID service would mess up your cert. I mean, we already have public/private keys. Is a specialized cert_sign in a particular format that breaks if you change names necessary?\n\nAlternatively we can look a bit further on what's actually going on behind the scenes, and perhaps fix it entirely? Perhaps certs should have a 'format' for the verification to take place?\n\n@nofish: I'm interested to see what you have to say. At the moment the cert_sign appears to me as a redundant check that breaks certs that use different formatting. Why not simply change the check to `useraddress#authtype/signersite`? Is there even a way to change this now that people have been using ZeroIDs? Would the 'format' option I described work?",

The big issue seems to be that there's no way to get the magnet link/torrent file from a video, meaning you can only ever seed it when you're on the page. And uploading is really glitchy, so if you use the direct thing, you're shit outta luck.\n\nI went ahead and mirrored some videos (Cosmos Laundromat, Fastcast vids, etc) as well as uploaded a new one of my own (Deadpool movie). For those who want to just manually upload stuff, here's my process:\n\n1. Drag/drop the movie into webtorrent. This is to start the seeding process. Don't include anything besides the mp4. Webms don't work, and I'm guessing stuff like AVIs don't work either.\n\n2. Right click on the newly seeded torrent and hit 'copy magnet link'. You'll paste this in the 'magnet' field on your data.json.\n\n3. Add a new video in your data.json. Here's the format:\n\n```\n{\n\"video_id\": \"\",\n\"title\": \"\",\n\"description\": \"\",\n\"magnet\": \"\",\n\"date_added\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nFor 'video_id', it's expecting the bittorrent hash listed under 'bith'. It's in the magnet link near the beginning. For date_added, my new entries have the format `2016-08-29T02:12:14.588Z`. (Edit: You can use [this site](http://www.unixtimestamp.com/) to generate a timestamp. Use the 'ISO 8601' one.)\n\nHave fun. Still no way to increase the seeds besides manually sharing the magnet link and downloading through webtorrent (or staying on the page). You can grab a video's magnet link in the same manner. Alternatively you can grab the bith from the end of the watching URL, and paste that right into webtorrent desktop.\n\nAnd remember, the more support ZeroTube gets, the more webtorrents are seeded for *any* webtorrent video service.

With dropbox gone, we really need a reliable webseed if we want P2P video sharing to take off. I'm not sure how long Peerify hosts videos for, so that's the point of this test. I've moved all my videos over for now, instead of just having me seed them 24/7. Hopefully this works better.\n\nI've also been trying to figure out how to rip video from [Bitchute](https://www.bitchute.com/) which relies on webtorrent and uses it's own webseeding server. However, there seems to be a CORS restriction or something that messes up the webseeding for anyone else. Kind of defeats the purpose of having it a torrent if no one else can help share the video. Amusingly, popping in the link into webtorrent desktop lets it stream just fine. So maybe it's a ZeroNet issue?\n\nEither way, I hope people *finally* start uploading some videos. The process is *real* simple now. Just upload your video on Peerify, copy the link, and paste that in KopyKate, being sure that the uploaded link is the .torrent, rather than the converted magnet link. From there, you can personally help seed by copying the KopyKate magnet into your own webtorrent desktop app.\n\nAlso, if anyone knows about other places that are big users of webtorrent, please mention where you saw it, as we can piggyback off their content.",

If your comments on my hub were placed in a different hub, I wouldn't be able to see them.\n\nIn reality, what we need is a profile page being determined solely by the 'hub' variable, and the posts to be fetched from a 'posted hubs' list (like a new variable listing the hubs you've posted in. This list would be fetched from the home hub.). I think that'd solve all the problems.\n\nEdit: As it is now, the URL defines which hub to load for your profile.

It's the ZeroMe frontend that causes the issues. Since it glitches with posts from multiple hubs (easy fix is to just check the hubs). And it also relies on the url to determine which hub your login/posts are in, which causes glitches (again, easy fix, just use the 'hub' variable in literally every hub data folder). That, and there's no 'migrate hub' button. Instead there's just a 'join hub', which deletes some data and such, and obviously that messes things up. It also doesn't switch the hub variable, or fix other things that could cause glitches.\n\nAfter those two things are fixed (in the ZeroMe site itself), then it should work fine. A ZeroMe clone could certainly be used for clean migrations. Amusingly, the old zerome would still support the migrated account, due to how things work. But it'd still run into the same glitches as it is now (duplicate likes, login issues, following old profiles, etc.).",

If you're censored on a hub, you can only migrate *your* content (comments and posts). Not anyone else's.\n\n>\"IMO, comments (posted by others) and likes should be in the sub folder of the user, which makes the user can control all of the comments and likes,\"\n\nComments and likes are posted on the appropriate hub that they refer to. I imagine that was by design, so that red hub users can see posts made on the red hub. Otherwise, you'd have to have every hub to see people's comments. Unless you meant comments posted by others going into your (OP) folder. Which is impossible, due to the way that ZeroNet authentication works. There's no way to touch another user's content. Period.\n\nAt best we keep it how it is, but correct the posts linkage issue (by relating comments/likes to same hub posts, and make a user's profile only ever link back to what's listed in the 'hub' entry).\n\n>\"All my comments posted to sub folder of an user in other hubs should be also backuped to my profile's hub and backup hubs in case of something unexpected happen.\"\n\nI wasn't even aware this was a possibility.

I can't seem to modify the script in such a way that makes http://zero/ fail with no script but pass without.\n\nCould you clarify what the problem is, exactly? The .pac should override `http://zero/[address]` and it should work fine. Are you resolving those addresses in a different manner?\n\nThe test by default displays 'fail' until it can run the two tests. The http://zero/ test involves a jquery ajax request to fetch a page from `http://zero/kaffie.bit/test.txt`. The zero:// test involves loading an iframe with the url `zero://1A83ijw3boqTtqdLz8me7AqeK1nEK8yxeu/test.html?zp&prtl=[origin]` and ZeroNet forcefully moves the iframe content to the main page (by reloading). This leads to the success of the second test.\n\nIf the first one isn't working, it sounds like either the jquery isn't being ran, or it's not grabbing the file.

The type of authentication. The username, and the cert_sign. The cert_sign is reconstructed on each users' machine following the formula given. And then compared to the one included in content.json (which is a copy of the one that the site provides). However, there's no guarantee the site will use said formula, and thus the publish is rejected despite having the private key correct.\n\nTo bypass this, you remove the auth_type and cert_sign provided in the content.json. Now that these are lacking, the cert_sign check is skipped and it just verifies that the private key was used and signed the stuff correctly.\n\nSo the cert_sign is entirely unneeded. It can be removed manually, and doesn't help authenticate anything. So I'm wondering why bother having it?

			"body": "@Sirenyc: Haven't updated the index for a while. Sorry.\n\n@Shellbound: Unfortunately most of the music I listen to isn't available for streaming on 'normal' services (spotify/google/tidal/etc). A few borderline illegal chinese services have some though :P.\n\n@TeddyDD: MusicBrainz is one of those things that I like (it's a pretty solid system/software) but it's incredibly lacking in info and has no easy way of submitting my hundreds of tagged songs that aren't in the DB.\n\n@Lain: It's already *technically* usable. It's pretty slow though, and lacks a lot of features I want to put in it. Right now it's a streamer/downloader for two popular chinese music sites: Xiami and Netease Music. Here's some screenshots:\n\n[artist page](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmWDSYSh2cEzUpnyLD4cPSWHcrVbNyg398JgbySeirb72x) - Grabs all the albums available, along with last.fm and musicbrainz data. Similar artists shown at the top there.\n\n[search results](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmaM7XN67F2kpzRaveyKTQ7hqGXPRySacoPGKoE5nsKGJ5) - Pretty straight forward. Shows the search results of whatever you're looking for.\n\n[Album page+playing queued songs](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmaicZJuVkMJgqQEZseVJY8uVp7kjKutqeUqMiQNrtSSF4) - Shows the tracks from both services, along with a variety of play/queue/download buttons. Has options to directly download a track or to download the whole album. The app automatically tags mp3s, and sorts into `artist/album/track.mp3`. Lyrics are obtained if available.\n\nI keep feeling like I should shift it over to QT or something, rather than have it a webapp. Since managing the queue and such is getting clunky (I redirect to a new player page, with an iframe of the viewed page, and then manage URL state directly). I use flask at the moment, which is why I'm getting a bit of lag between pages switches (has to load content from two different chinese sites, then manage the data, maybe grab more content, etc.). The downloading isn't perfect yet (no downloads from netease), the merging is still a mess. And there's no easy way to manage your catalogue. No importing/uploads/whatever, as it's just a stream+download tool at the moment. I want to throw in a thing to log the data viewed into a database of some sort. Initially I thought maybe sending that to a hosted DB somewhere would work, but I want users to have access to it, and to not have the DB swarmed. I made a crawler for Xiami, but I haven't written stuff for logging just yet. I've mostly just worked on it off/on for the past while now. Xiami changed things up mid-dev, so I had to spend a lot of time fixing it. And netease seems to constantly shift their cdn stuff, which makes it keep breaking.\n\n@Icf20: Looks like that's just ripping from youtube. Won't work for my purposes.\n\n@Johnhamelink: I've seen beets, and it seems like it grabs from the usual sources :\\\\. I haven't seen the mopidy stuff though. I'll have to look into it.",

Once that's done, I should be able to write a plugin for *any* music source that provides a few basic features (search, grab albums by artist, grab tracks by album, etc.) I was actually wondering if I could implement it with IPFS/ZeroNet, so that when people listen to tracks and dl info, it automatically adds it to zn/ipfs so that it's accessible even without the 3rd party sites. But as I said, I don't really have a plan yet for migrating away from these sites (and they've screwed things up in the past).",

Those can be found if you click on 'scripts' or check out the Kaffiene github repo. For the ZeroMe profiles, it's a new script I wrote (not pushed yet), that once again fetches them and compiles them into a document for searching.\n\nI'm wondering if there's a way to do the ZeroMe profiles with just javascript, so I don't have to focus on updating, like how the various off-site indexes work. I'd need access to the merged-zerome/zerome.db database to do so. But that's pretty big at 30mb for mine (with all the hubs) whereas the profile index is at only 700kb.\n\nThe \"backend\" is just me haha. No fancy bots/crawlers/taggers/whatever yet. That's on the agenda and why Kaffiene's index hasn't been updated in months. If you check the dropdown menu you can look at the untagged sites the scripts found. I don't have a way of automatically tagging them yet. That's a WIP. Once I get that done though it'll be smooth sailing.",

It's not a separate file or anything, and thus when compiled will still result in filesize bloat.\n\nWhat I'd *like* to do is be able to simply read another site's merged db. That'd make it real easy. The other problem with making it a zerome merger site is that part of my future plans for Kaffiene involve moving the search indexes over to a hub system so that people can merely download and contribute to different hubs to get a more personalized search.

It ain't perfect, but it works real well if all you want is some simple movie lookup/browser streaming. Let me know if there's any issues. The site uses a hack to escape ZeroNet's iframe, and exposes your browser to clearnet servers, so there's a disclaimer and a 'launch' button on the main page. Hopefully that's not an issue for anyone but it *does* make the site a bit more clunky.\n\nMovie lookup pulls from IMDB, posters/backdrop from themoviedb.org and the streams themselves from vodlocker.to (mostly hosted on google it seems). I've been playing around with it for a while and it works great. Full screen works fine, movies load quick, and there's a huge selection (though the site will still display movies that are unavailable). Vodlocker advertises chromecast support, but I've never seen the option.",

Anyway, it's all [here](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity) which is where google shows you the info they have on you. Kinda creepy if you aren't aware of some of it. But a lot of it is standard fare: google searches, voice queries, etc. As I said, what creeped *me* out wasn't that stuff (though it was a bit creepy/weird seeing it all together like that), it was the *app usage*. That is \"Kaffie used app X at time Y\". And you can filter out the other stuff to just show app usage. So it'd look something like this:\n\n8:00am - used Clock app\n8:10am - used google news app\n8:30am - used clash of clans\n9:14am - used period tracker\n9:20am - used gmail\n9:30am - used discord\n\nAnd so on. That's obviously just a fake history (I deleted my own and disabled tracking). Very creepy. But indeed, it stopped displaying on that page once I disabled all the options. I also switched my launcher for good measure. As for whether I explicitly enabled it... no. I was not aware of any such tracking. I knew my *web results* would be tracked if I used google. And I knew that gmail, google news, and the like would be tracked. I also knew the voice thing would be tracked. But regular app usage? Even when offline? How the hell would I know that's tracked?\n\nUpon researching, the *actual* option is \"web and app activity\" or something like that. Meaning you can't have it track the web stuff for personalization and still keep your privacy when it comes to apps. Given I had no idea it was even tracked, I'm skeptical disabling it actually disables tracking. Like, perhaps they just don't show me it >_>",

I literally cloned his site, engine, index, etc. and just built on it and improved the usability. I'm fairly open about credit. I coded the ZeroWiki info box, but ofc. I didn't come up with that idea on my own. Just like many of the features in Kaffiene. I simply implemented them after they were suggested. However, I don't claim to have made things that I took. The index format? That wasn't me at all (except the addition of siterank).\n\n@Jayofthezero: It previously used an XMLHttpRequest to fetch the .db file from ZeroWiki, and then searched through it. However, now it uses the new remote fileget and cors permission to fetch the file. You can check it out on the [Github](https://github.com/April93/Kaffiene/blob/master/index.html#L25). Or just looking at the first few lines of index.html in the kaffiene folder.\n\nThere's a lot of parsing and formatting to make the results good. You can find that in the [fetchfromdb()](https://github.com/April93/Kaffiene/blob/master/index.html#L134) function. Located a bit later down.",

The webseed urls are embedded into the .torrent file and will connect in even a regular torrenting client.\n\nSo if you hosted a .torrent file on a ZN site, and then loaded it through webrtc, you could still have webseeded content on other sites. You can easily use the site *without* webseeds. Just post magnet links and seed the videos yourself. The problem is that that leads to videos going down and becoming dead. But yeah, the page should probably alert about external hosts.",

Still accessing clearnet sites though, which I know a lot of people have issues with.\n\n\"To get something without anyone knowing it would require shut off all the good stuff from the torrent client, making it barely any better than a web downloader.\"\n\nThat's probably true. Keep in mind, webtorrent runs through webrtc as well, which has had some risks of exposing IP. But there's nothing stopping you from downloading the .torrent and popping it into webtorrent desktop or vuze or something.",
