Otherwise, add a few hub, which hub can not choose to speak.\n\n\nZeronet is a small multi-user operating system based on the network hardware layer. Truly the network layer has a self-owned personal network pc, no external management of your network computer.\n\nWant to have a network PC operating system? Welcome to zeronet. Ownership of this network computer will be your own, no longer have the administrator to manage your own network computer. Realize the network interoperability stand-alone.\n\nIf www is a Microsoft operating system, zeronet is the linux operating system.\n\nPerhaps there will be better, zeronet has achieved a prototype.\n\nOf course, many people do not like and accept the rudimentary interface of linux. But it is indeed free and unlikely to be poisoned.\n\nPerhaps www's Ddos attack does not exist in zeronet.",
