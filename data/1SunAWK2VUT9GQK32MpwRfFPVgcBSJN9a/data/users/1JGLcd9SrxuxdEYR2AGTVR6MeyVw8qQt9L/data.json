It doesn't use ZeroNet features since it was a direct mirror that I did back in the early days of ZeroNet. I moved some of the screencasts to optional files and I've been thinking how best to make some of the other content optional - eg, maybe making only the main page and posts on the main page non-optional files.\n\nThe reason it probably didn't work for you is exactly the file size. Some seeders have never agreed to the file increase - maybe they are proxies or not operated by a human. As a result there's nodes out there serving old content. At least that's what I see when I sometimes try to get it on a new node - I get an old version where I had tried removing all the files to get it to seed.",
