			"body": "It's Dec 6th and I took a look at your site.  While I can see the '/uimedia/master.css' line in your index.html, there isn't any such directory or file that currently exists by that name and hence the problem.\n\nWhen I publish my sites, I try to push a few copies into a few zeronet proxies. There's like 2 functional ones available. Then after I do a few updates be sure to do the python zeronet.py siteSign command to sign the changes and a python zeronet.py sitePublish one to two times will get everything propagated throughout the network.\n\nHope that helps and hope to see your site up & running with style. :)",
