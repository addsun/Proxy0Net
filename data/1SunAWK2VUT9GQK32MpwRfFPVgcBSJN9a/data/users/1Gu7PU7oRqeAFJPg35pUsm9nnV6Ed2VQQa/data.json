I'm just greeted with general indifference and casual, lazy acceptance when I speak.\n\nHow do you tell someone that it's all poison, right down to the copper?  How to do you explain Room 641A and the Utah Datacenter to someone who doesn't even understand how their computer works?  How do you tell people that Facebook's move to OAuth provides a defacto identity authority?\n\nI want to lower the bar of entry into systems like ZeroNet, perhaps not this one specifically (although, so far, I'm a huge fan) but just towards the decentralization in general.  Who had ideas on this?",
