Of course while I was sick the 30 day free trial of WebStorm ran out so now I have to switch my Dart development over to the Visual Studio Code editor + console commands. Someone donated ~$6 in Bitcoin to me last month (thanks so much!), that would actually cover the monthly cost for WebStorm (it's â‚¬5 I think), especially since the price of Bitcoin has gone up since then so now it's worth $8, but aside from me not really wanting to spend money for a text editor, if I look at the current fee for Bitcoin transactions... Whoa.\n\nThe recommended fee was about $55 two days ago for a small $10 transaction, and now it seems to fluctuate between $5 and $15, so I can't really use my Bitcoin Visa card right now, that's just too much money for me and I have no idea how long it takes (if it is even going through at all) if you use a smaller transaction fee. It's starting to look like Bitcoin is going to die as a currency and is just going to be a store of value in the future, like gold. Might have to replace my donation link with a different currency and get a new Visa card for that currency. There is a Dash & Ethereum Visa card, so those two would be alternatives to Bitcoin.\n\nDash has the advantage that it has anonymity baked in, while the Ethereum price is probably more stable (although I'm wary of that, Ethereum keeps popping up in the news for losing hundreds of millions after hacks). Dash has gone up extremely in the last week or so, could come crashing down again any moment so it's a gamble to buy that right now. Can't decide! What do you guys and gals here use?",

Maybe it's peer to peer connection troubles. Not an expert but I think it works like this: If you use Tor and a direct connection with an open port together on ZeroNet, you can receive from and send files to anyone on ZeroNet, so these people act as bridges for people who haven't opened ZeroNet's port in their router or use Tor always mode to stay anonymous and hide their IP address and therefore can only connect to other Tor users (that's what I do). If you use Tor and the person whose picture you wanted to view doesn't and nobody else who could act as a bridge between you two has downloaded the picture yet, you can't download the picture from anyone, so you'll have to wait until more people downloaded it, or if you don't use Tor try using it to see if it works better, or if you don't want Tor but can open your port in your router, open it.",

And for cases were that doesn't help, there is the merger site feature which ZeroMe uses (the hubs, basically).",

Maybe there will be some automatic AI type stuff in the future that writes secure, bug free contracts, but until then it seems like a cool theory that just doesn't work in practice.

If I have to pay a $5 tx fee on a $10 or $20 transaction, that'd be silly. Ethereum Classic I'll have to look into more. I even had one ETH classic left over from the fork, but sold it a while ago since I wasn't interested in Ethereum anymore. I did agree with the forking into Ethereum Classic back when it happened, as much as I felt for the people who lost money, the Ethereum blockchain lost all credibility when the devs stole the money back from the hacker, you just can't do that and still claim the blockchain is immutable. If you can even call the guy who did it a hacker since he just used the smart contract exactly like it was programmed to work, just not as it was intended by the developers. And the legal consequences are also troublesome, now a judge can order the ETH devs to freeze accounts, they did it before so they cannot claim that's not possible. At least that's what people were talking about back then, haven't followed up on it after that, I've stayed away from Ethereum ever since they did that, needed the money anyhow, still had about 15 Ethereum at that point. Would have been worth a lot more today of course :D",

As for availability in countries, I guess that is up to Visa card dealers and not the blockchain services that make use of it, so it's probably the same ~45 supported countries everywhere. It's just a temporary solution anyway, ideally at some point there is going to be a pure cryptocurrency card that can be used with all altcoins, one that is not tied to a corporation like Visa or Mastercard, which stores will accept just like Visa and MasterCard as cryptocurrencies become more popular because their customers want to pay with it. There are already some huge companies that directly accept Bitcoin, like Steam, so this would be the logical next step.",
