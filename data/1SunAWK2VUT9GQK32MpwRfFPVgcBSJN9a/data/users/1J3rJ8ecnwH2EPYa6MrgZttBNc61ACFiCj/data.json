It's a bit slower this way, maybe a read cache could help to avoid re-reading big files using fileGet. \nThe bigger files also triggered an error when reading files from different sites at the same time. (already fixed, but need some more testing, will roll out tomorrow) \nBtw. why does it needs to read ZeroID site?",
