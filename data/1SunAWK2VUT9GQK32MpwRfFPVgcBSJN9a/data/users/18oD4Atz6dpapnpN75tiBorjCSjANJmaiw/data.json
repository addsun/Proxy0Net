But due the larger transaction size tx fees also are large enough, about $1.5 per regular transaction. Monero has addoption on dark markets. Zcash provide a new type private transactions based on zk-proofs. But it requires trusted parameters which was created during zcash ceremony (google it). Also private transactions in Zcash are not mandatory and optional. Dash privacy is weak compared to the two above and it is not focused on privacy as its primary feature.\n\nSecond cryptocurrency I like is Ethereum Classic. It is mostly the same with Ethereum on its features but (will) have a deflationary monetary policy comparable with Bitcoin. Unlike Ethereum there is no a centralized foundation behind Classic.",
