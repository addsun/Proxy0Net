GamerGate is pretty much entirely over and few people bring it up anywhere anymore from what I've seen. /pol/ there is more focused, but also overtly \"hitler or GTFO\", whereas 4pol is more ironic about that. This is important because there is a lot of cross-pollination with 8pol and the other boards, since the whole site is smaller, but /leftypol/ also exists. ",

Smaller, more focused communities, 4chan has really become too mainstream, more teenagers on there. I have seen /pol/ attitudes in the other boards occasionally, but it's less meme-y, and often correctly called out as off-topic. I do think 8ch runs the risk of getting ICANNed in the near future due to /pol/, whereas 4chan would probably just delete their /pol/ altogether if it came down to it, bigger site would be given some time to react. In which case, that's why we have 0chan.",
