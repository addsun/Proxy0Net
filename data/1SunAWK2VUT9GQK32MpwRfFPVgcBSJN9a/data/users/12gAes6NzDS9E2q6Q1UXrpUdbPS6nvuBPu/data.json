Right now it's actually functional and usable - we already have many pretty good zites: ZeroMe, ZeroMail, ZeroTalk, ZeroVoat, ZeroSites, Kopy Kate, Thunderwave, ZeroBlog, ZeroNet Dev Center (the questions part), ZeroWiki, 0Play, ZeroTV (not being updated anymore afaik), Git Over ZeroNet, Search Engines like Kaffie, Zirch, and RVRE, IFS, something that I'm currently working on that will be released hopefully soon. Sure these may not be as good as the clearnet alternatives, but that's what you get when you are dealing with only a subset of the clearnet (no php/nodejs, no instant updates because there's not a central server so everything needs to be signed and published, etc.) IMO, ZeroNet has done some things that are kinda cool and would at the very least qualify it as a beta (considering how easy it is to setup, although could probably still be improved, how friendly it is to navigate, and all the different zites we have) - MergerZites, Optional Files, [Big File Support](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/7) *coming soon* (I believe this includes *streaming* content), Cloning, the way it handles Users, etc.",

How would other people be able to post when signing in doesn't work at least some of the time *or* previously. Meaning, there is authorization (in the sense of signin in) but it seems you assumed not because the sign in wasn't working. However, assuming isn't so good considering the signin is supposed to work and either has worked or is working for some people. So instead of making assumptions, **maybe you can try giving me details of what isn't working and what exactly you did that led up to it not working.**",

Btw, good luck with trying to update content dynamically with jQuery :) For me, I'd never do it that way because everything gets disorganized, hard to read, you have to do a lot of things manually, you have to mess with id's or classes all of the time. But If it works well for you, then that all that's matters.",
